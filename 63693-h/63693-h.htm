  <h2 class='c008'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Mr. Upton Sinclair needs no introduction to the public as
a fearless, honest, and critical student of public affairs. But in the
present book he has with characteristic courage entered a new field,
one in which reputations are more easily lost than made, the field
of Psychic Research. When he does me the honor to ask me to write
a few words of introduction to this book, a refusal would imply on
my part a lack either of courage or of due sense of scientific responsibility.
I have long been keenly interested in this field; and it is
not necessary to hold that the researches of the past fifty years have
brought any solidly established conclusions in order to feel sure
that further research is very much worth while. Even if the results
of such research should in the end prove wholly negative that would
be a result of no small importance; for from many points of view
it is urgently to be wished that we may know where we stand in this
question of the reality of alleged supernormal phenomena. In discussing
this question recently with a small group of scientific men,
one of them (who is perhaps the most prominent and influential of
American psychologists) seemed to feel that the whole problem was
settled in the negative when he asserted that at the present time no
American psychologist of standing took any interest in this field.
I do not know whether he meant to deny my Americanism or my
standing, neither of which I can establish. But his remark if it were
true, would not in any degree support his conclusion; it would
rather be a grave reproach to American psychologists. Happily it is
possible to name several younger American psychologists who are
keenly interested in the problem of telepathy.</p>

<p class='c010'>And it is with experiments in telepathy that Mr. Sinclair’s
book is chiefly concerned. In this part, as in other parts, of the
field of Psychic Research, progress must largely depend upon such
work by intelligent educated laymen or amateurs as is here reported.
For facility in obtaining seemingly supernormal phenomena
seems to be of rare and sporadic occurrence; and it is the duty
of men of science to give whatever encouragement and sympathetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>support may be possible to all amateurs who find themselves in
a position to observe and carefully and honestly to study such
phenomena.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Sinclair would seem to be one of the rare persons who
have telepathic power in a marked degree and perhaps other supernormal
powers. The experiments in telepathy, as reported in the
pages of this book, were so remarkably successful as to rank among
the very best hitherto reported. The degree of success and the
conditions of experiment were such that we can reject them as
conclusive evidence of some mode of communication not at present
explicable in accepted scientific terms only by assuming that Mr.
and Mrs. Sinclair either are grossly stupid, incompetent and careless
persons or have deliberately entered upon a conspiracy to
deceive the public in a most heartless and reprehensible fashion.
I have unfortunately no intimate personal knowledge of Mr. and
Mrs. Sinclair; but I am acquainted with some of Mr. Sinclair’s
earlier publications; and that acquaintance suffices to convince me,
as it should convince any impartial reader, that he is an able and
sincere man with a strong sense of right and wrong and of individual
responsibility. His record and his writings should secure a
wide and respectful hearing for what he has to tell us in the following
pages.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Sinclair’s account of her condition during successful experiments
seems to me particularly interesting; for it falls into line
with what has been observed by several other workers; namely, they
report that a peculiar passive mental state or attitude seems to be
a highly favorable, if not an essential, condition of telepathic communication.
It would seem that if the faint and unusual telepathic
processes are to manifest themselves, the track of the mind must be
kept clear of other traffic.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other experiments reported in the book seem to imply some
supernormal power of perception of physical things such as is commonly
called clairvoyance. It is natural and logical that alleged
instances of clairvoyance should have from most of us a reception
even more skeptical than that we accord to telepathic claims. After
all, a mind at work is an active agent of whose nature and activity
our knowledge is very imperfect; and science furnishes us no good
reasons for denying that its activity may affect another mind in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>some fashion utterly obscure to us. But when an experimenter
seems to have large success in reading printed words shut in a thick-walled
box, words whose identity is unknown to any human being,
we seem to be more nearly in a position to assert positively—That
cannot occur! For we do seem to know with very fair completeness
the possibilities of influence extending from the printed word to
the experimenter; and under the conditions all such possibilities
seem surely excluded. Yet here also we must keep the open mind,
gather the facts, however unintelligible they may seem at present,
repeating observations under varied conditions.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Mrs. Sinclair’s clairvoyant successes do not stand alone.
They are in line with the many successful “book-tests” recorded of
recent years by competent workers of the English Society for Psychical
Research, as well as with many other less carefully observed
and recorded incidents.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Sinclair’s book will amply justify itself if it shall lead a
few (let us say two per cent) of his readers to undertake carefully
and critically experiments similar to those which he has so vividly
described.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich habe das Buch von Upton Sinclair mit grossem Interesse
gelesen und bin überzeugt, dass dasselbe die ernsteste Beachtung,
nicht nur der Laien, sondern auch der Psychologen von Fach
verdient. Die Ergebnisse der in diesem Buch sorgfältig und deutlich
beschriebenen telepathischen Experimente stehen sicher weit
ausserhalb desjenigen, was ein Naturforscher für denkbar hält.
Andererseit aber ist es bei einem so gewissenhaften Beobachter und
Schriftsteller wie Upton Sinclair ausgeschlossen, dass er eine
bewusste Täuschung der Leserwelt anstrebt; seine <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fides</span> und
Zuverlässigkeit darf nicht bezweifelt werden. Wenn also etwa die
mit grosser Klarheit dargestellten Tatsachen nicht auf Telepathie,

    <div>PREFACE</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>I have read the book of Upton Sinclair with great interest
and am convinced that the same deserves the most earnest consideration,
not only of the laity, but also of the psychologists by
profession. The results of the telepathic experiments carefully and
plainly set forth in this book stand surely far beyond those which
a nature investigator holds to be thinkable. On the other hand,
it is out of the question in the case of so conscientious an observer
and writer as Upton Sinclair that he is carrying on a conscious
deception of the reading world; his good faith and dependability
are not to be doubted. So if somehow the facts here set forth rest
not upon telepathy, but upon some unconscious hypnotic influence
from person to person, this also would be of high psychological
interest. In no case should the psychologically interested circles
pass over this book heedlessly.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>I contemplated a statement introducing this book to the
reader, but on further thought I realized that the book introduces
itself and speaks for itself all the way through. I will only say that
Mary Craig Kimbrough was my wife for almost half a century.
She guarded me, managed me, and worried about me during that
period—for the task was an unending one. I was often engaged in
politically and socially dangerous tasks, and Craig was the one who
realized the dangers and undertook the task of saving me. This
went on all through our marriage, and in the end her heart weakened,
and for almost ten years I dropped all my other tasks and
devoted myself to keeping her alive. She died in April, 1961.</p>

<p class='c010'>I wrote the text of <cite>Mental Radio</cite>, 1929, under her direction;
she revised every word and had it exactly the way she wanted it.
She was the most conscientious and morally exacting person I have
ever known. Loyalty to the truth was her religion; and every
sentence in this book was studied so that it would be exactly true
and so clear that nobody could misunderstand it. She knew just
how we did our experiments; she had told me exactly what to do,
and I had done it; if I set it down wrong in the manuscript, she
made it right.</p>

<p class='c010'>She has told of her early psychic experiences, and they were
enough to fill her with determination to make sure they were real,
and if possible to find out what they meant. It was she who laid
down all the procedures in our tests. It was she who studied the
results and got the record exact to the last comma. In reading this
book bear in mind, there are no errors. If the book says that the
experiment was done in a certain precise way, that is the way it was
done; and always it was done without prejudice, without a preconception
or anything that could affect the result. When the
record was put on paper every word had to be studied, and every
little mistake that I made had to be corrected by her tenacious
memory.</p>

<p class='c010'>So trust this book. Understand that what is told here happened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>exactly as it has been told. Don’t think that maybe there was a
slight slip, or that there is a careless word. I remember in the
course of the years some learned psychologist suggesting that maybe
Craig had unconsciously got some idea of what the drawings were
by seeing the movement of my pen or pencil. This meant just one
thing—the learned gentleman didn’t want to believe, and hadn’t
taken the trouble to go back and study the book. You who are going
to read now will note again and again that I went into another
room to make the drawing, and I shut the door. Make note now
and bear it in mind all through the book, I never made a drawing
in the same room with Craig; and always the door was shut. To
have done otherwise would have been to waste her time as well as
mine, and she saw to it that I did not waste either. She wanted to
<em>know</em>; she was <em>determined</em> to <em>know</em>; she laid down the law, and I
obeyed it. The only way you can reject the evidence in this book is
to decide that we were a pair of unconscionable rascals.</p>

<p class='c010'>I’ll give you one opinion about that. Albert Einstein, possessor
of one of the greatest modern brains, and also of a high character,
was one of our close friends. He came to our home, and we came
to his, and he witnessed some of our experiments. When this book
was ready for publication in 1929 I sent him a set of the proofs and
asked him if he would care to write a preface for the German
edition. He consented and wrote the letter in German to the
German publisher. Unfortunately, the publisher went out of
business.</p>

<p class='c010'>What you are going to read is the exact text of Craig’s book
as it was written in the year 1929 and published in the next year.
The only changes I have made have to do with the lapse of thirty
years since the text was written. Near the end are one or two
references to friends who have since died, but you probably never
knew those persons, so it doesn’t matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the end of the book I have published a few comments on
it, and an account, written by myself, of later experiments. Also
I give an extensive summary of the results of a study of the drawings
published by Dr. Walter Franklin Prince, a Boston clergyman who
resigned from his pulpit in order to become Research Officer of
the Boston Society for Psychic Research. Dr. Prince asked if we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>would be willing to entrust the documents to his examination, and
I immediately bundled them up and sent them to him by registered
mail. The long commentary which he wrote appeared in the
<cite>Bulletin</cite> of the society for April, 1932.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps the most important single item concerning <cite>Mental
Radio</cite> is the following:</p>

<p class='c010'>Prof. William MacDougall, who had been head of the Department
of Psychology at Oxford University and later head of the
Department of Psychology at Harvard—and who had won the title
of “Dean of American Psychology”—came to see us in Pasadena
soon after the publication of this book. He told Craig that he had
just accepted the job of head of the Department of Psychology at
Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, and would have at his
disposal a considerable fund for research. He had read <cite>Mental
Radio</cite> and had written the preface which is in this book, and he
said that he would like to be able to say that he himself had witnessed
a test of the genuineness of Craig’s telepathic power.</p>

<p class='c010'>Craig had always shrunk from anything of that sort because
her power depended entirely upon solitude and concentration; but
her respect for MacDougall was great, and she told him she would
do her best. He said that he had some pictures in his inside coat
pocket, and he would like to see if she could describe them. She sat
quietly with her eyes closed and presently said that she saw a building
with stone walls and narrow windows, and it seemed to be
covered with green leaves. MacDougall took from his inside coat
pocket a postcard of one of the buildings at Oxford covered with ivy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other tests with him will appear later. Here I add one more
story, how we took the good man for a test with Arthur Ford, who
was then head of a spiritualistic church in Los Angeles. I had picked
out four letters or postcards from well-known persons, one of them
Jack London and another Georg Brandes, the Danish critic, highly
respected. I wrapped each of these documents in a sheet of green
paper to remove any possibility of holding them up to the light
or otherwise getting a glimpse. I showed this to MacDougall, and
he agreed that the concealment was effective. We then sealed them
in four numbered envelopes, and in a little ante-room of the church
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>Arthur Ford lay back in his chair, covered his eyes with a handkerchief,
and put the envelopes one by one on his forehead.</p>

<p class='c010'>I subsequently wrote an article about the experiment which
was published in the <cite>Psychic Observer</cite>, but I do not have the text
at hand. Ford told us significant things about the contents of all
those envelopes, and I remember that afterwards MacDougall,
Craig and I strolled down the street and stopped at a little kiosk
where we ordered lemonade or orange juice. I said, “Well, what
do you think of it?” and MacDougall’s answer was, “I should say
that it is undoubtedly supernormal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He then told Craig that what she had done had already decided
him—he was going to Duke University in a week or two and his
first action would be to set up a Department of Parapsychology.
That was a little over thirty years ago, and I think it is correct to
say that what MacDougall did, with the help of J. B. Rhine, his
assistant and later his successor, has made the subject of Parapsychology
scientifically respectable throughout the United States and
Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now, to the text, as published, 1931.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c003'><em>1</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>If you were born as long as fifty years ago, you can remember
a time when the test of a sound, common-sense mind was refusing
to fool with “new-fangled notions.” Without exactly putting it into
a formula, people took it for granted that truth was known and
familiar, and anything that was not known and familiar was nonsense.
In my boyhood, the funniest joke in the world was a “flying
machine man”; and when my mother took up a notion about
“germs” getting into you and making you sick, my father made it a
theme for no end of domestic wit. Even as late as twenty years ago,
when I wanted to write a play based on the idea that men might
some day be able to make a human voice audible to groups of
people all over America, my friends assured me that I could not
interest the public in such a fantastic notion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among the objects of scorn, in my boyhood, was what we called
“superstition”; and we made the term include, not merely the
notion that the number thirteen brought you bad luck, not merely
a belief in witches, ghosts and goblins, but also a belief in any
strange phenomena of the mind which we did not understand.
We knew about hypnotism, because we had seen stage performances,
and were in the midst of reading a naughty book called
<cite>Trilby</cite>; but such things as trance mediumship, automatic writing,
table-tapping, telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance—we didn’t
know these long names, but if such ideas were explained to us, we
knew right away that it was “all nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In my youth I had the experience of meeting a scholarly
Unitarian clergyman, the Rev. Minot J. Savage of New York, who
assured me quite seriously that he had seen and talked with ghosts.
He didn’t convince me, but he sowed the seed of curiosity in my
mind, and I began reading books on psychic research. From first
to last, I have read hundreds of volumes; always interested, and
always uncertain—an uncomfortable mental state. The evidence in
support of telepathy came to seem to me conclusive, yet it never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>quite became real to me. The consequences of belief would be so
tremendous, the changes it would make in my view of the universe
so revolutionary, that I didn’t believe, even when I said I did.</p>

<p class='c010'>But for thirty years the subject has been among the things I
hoped to know about; and, as it happened, fate was planning to
favor me. It sent me a wife who became interested, and who not
merely investigated telepathy, but learned to practice it. For three
years I watched and assisted in this work, day by day and night by
night, in our home. So I could say that I was no longer guessing.
Now I really know. I am going to tell you about it, and hope to
convince you; but regardless of what anybody can say, there will
never again be a doubt about it in my mind. I <span class='fss'>KNOW</span>!</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
  <h3 class='c003'><em>2</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Telepathy, or mind-reading: that is to say, can one human
mind communicate with another human mind, except by the sense
channels ordinarily known and used—seeing, hearing, feeling, tasting
and touching? Can a thought or image in one mind be sent
directly to another mind and there reproduced and recognized? If
this can be done, how is it done? Is it some kind of vibration, going
out from the brain, like radio broadcasting? Or is it some contact
with a deeper level of mind, as bubbles on a stream have contact
with the water of the stream? And if this power exists, can it be
developed and used? Is it something that manifests itself now and
then, like a lightning flash, over which we have no control? Or can
we make the energy and store it, and use it regularly, as we have
learned to do with the lightning which Franklin brought from the
clouds?</p>

<p class='c010'>These are the questions; and the answers, as well as I can summarize
them, are as follows: Telepathy is real; it does happen.
Whatever may be the nature of the force, it has nothing to do with
distance, for it works exactly as well over forty miles as over a few
feet. And while it may be spontaneous and may depend upon a
special endowment, it can be cultivated and used deliberately, as
any other object of study, in physics and chemistry. The essential
in this training is an art of mental concentration and auto-suggestion,
which can be learned. I am going to tell you not merely what
you can do, but how you can do it, so that if you have patience and
real interest, you can make your own contribution to knowledge.</p>

<p class='c010'>Starting the subject, I am like the wandering book-agent or
peddler who taps on your door and gets you to open it, and has to
speak quickly and persuasively, putting his best goods foremost.
Your prejudice is against this idea; and if you are one of my old-time
readers, you are a little shocked to find me taking up a new and
unexpected line of activity. You have come, after thirty years, to
the position where you allow me to be one kind of “crank,” but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>you won’t stand for two kinds. So let me come straight to the point—open
up my pack, pull out my choicest wares, and catch your
attention with them if I can.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here is a drawing of a table-fork. It was done with a lead-pencil
on a sheet of ruled paper, which has been photographed,
and then reproduced in the ordinary way. You note that it bears
a signature and a date (Fig. <a href='#fig_1'>1</a>):</p>

<div id='fig_1'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_006.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 1</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This drawing was produced by my brother-in-law, Robert L.
Irwin, a young business man, and no kind of “crank,” under the
following circumstances. He was sitting in a room in his home in
Pasadena at a specified hour, eleven-thirty in the morning of July
13, 1928, having agreed to make a drawing of any object he might
select, at random, and then to sit gazing at it, concentrating his
entire attention upon it for a period of from fifteen to twenty
minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the same agreed hour, eleven-thirty in the morning of July
13, 1928, my wife was lying on the couch in her study, in our home
in Long Beach, forty miles away by the road. She was in semi-darkness,
with her eyes closed; employing a system of mental concentration
which she has been practicing off and on for several
years, and mentally suggesting to her subconscious mind to bring
her whatever was in the mind of her brother-in-law. Having become
satisfied that the image which came to her mind was the correct
one—because it persisted, and came back again and again—she
sat up and took pencil and paper and wrote the date, and six words,
as follows (Fig. <a href='#fig_1a'>1a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>A day or two later we drove to Pasadena, and then in the
presence of Bob and his wife, the drawing and writing were produced
and compared. I have in my possession affidavits from Bob,
his wife, and my wife, to the effect that the drawing and writing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>were produced in this way. Later in this book I shall present four
other pairs of drawings, made in the same way, three of them
equally successful.</p>

<div id='fig_1a'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_007a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 1a</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Second case. Here is a drawing (Fig. <a href='#fig_2'>2</a>), and below it a set of
five drawings (Fig. <a href='#fig_2a'>2a</a>):</p>

<div id='fig_2'  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>
</div>

<div id='fig_2a'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_007c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 2a</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The above drawings were produced under the following circumstances.
The single drawing (Fig. <a href='#fig_2'>2</a>) was made by me in my
study at my home. I was alone, and the door was closed before the
drawing was made, and was not opened until the test was concluded.
Having made the drawing, I held it before me and concentrated
upon it for a period of five or ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The five drawings (Fig. <a href='#fig_2a'>2a</a>) were produced by my wife, who
was lying on the couch in her study, some thirty feet away from
me, with the door closed between us. The only words spoken were
as follows: when I was ready to make my drawing, I called, “All
right,” and when she had completed her drawings, she called “All
right”—whereupon I opened the door and took my drawing to her
and we compared them. I found that in addition to the five little
pictures, she had written some explanation of how she came to draw
them. This I shall quote and discuss later on. I shall also tell about
six other pairs of drawings, produced at this same time.</p>

<p class='c010'>Third case: another drawing (Fig. <a href='#fig_3a'>3a</a>), produced under the
following circumstances. My wife went upstairs, and shut the door
which is at the top of the stairway. I went on tip-toe to a cupboard
in a downstairs room and took from a shelf a red electric-light bulb—it
having been agreed that I should select any small article, of
which there were certainly many hundreds in our home. I wrapped
this bulb in several thicknesses of newspaper, and put it, so wrapped,
in a shoe-box, and wrapped the shoe-box in a whole newspaper,
and tied it tightly with a string. I then called my wife and she came
downstairs, and lay on her couch and put the box on her body, over
the solar plexus. I sat watching, and never took my eyes from her,
nor did I speak a word during the test. Finally she sat up, and made
her drawing, with the written comment, and handed it to me.
Every word of the comment, as well as the drawing, was produced
before I said a word, and the drawing and writing as here reproduced
have not been touched or altered in any way (Fig. <a href='#fig_3a'>3a</a>):</p>

<div id='fig_3a'  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
<img src='images/i_009.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 3a</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The text of my wife’s written comment is as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“First see round glass. Guess nose glasses? No. Then comes
V shape again with a ‘button’ in top. Button stands out from
object. This round top is of different color from lower part. It is
light color, the other part is dark.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To avoid any possible misunderstanding, perhaps I should
state that the question and answer in the above were my wife’s
description of her own mental process, and do not represent a question
asked of me. She did not “guess” aloud, nor did either of
us speak a single word during this test, except the single word,
“Ready,” to call my wife downstairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next drawings were produced in the following manner.
The one at the top (Fig. <a href='#fig_4'>4</a>) was drawn by me alone in my study,
and was one of nine, all made at the same time, and with no restriction
upon what I should draw—anything that came into my head.
Having made the nine drawings, I wrapped each one in a separate
sheet of green paper, to make it absolutely invisible, and put each
one in a plain envelope and sealed it, and then took the nine sealed
envelopes and laid them on the table by my wife’s couch. My wife
then took one of them and placed it over her solar plexus, and lay
in her state of concentration, while I sat watching her, at her insistence,
in order to make the evidence more convincing. Having
received what she considered a convincing telepathic “message,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>or image of the contents of the envelope, she sat up and made her
sketch (Fig. <a href='#fig_4a'>4a</a>) on a pad of paper.</p>

<div id='fig_4'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_010a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 4</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id='fig_4a'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_010b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 4a</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The essence of our procedure is this: that never did she see
my drawing until hers was completed and her descriptive words
written; that I spoke no word and made no comment until after
this was done; and that the drawings presented here are in every
case exactly what I drew, and the corresponding drawing is exactly
what my wife drew, with no change or addition whatsoever. In
the case of this particular pair, my wife wrote, “Inside of rock well
with vines climbing on outside.” Such was her guess as to the drawing,
which I had meant for a bird’s nest surrounded by leaves; but
you see that the two drawings are for practical purposes identical.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many tests have been made, by each of the different methods
above outlined, and the results will be given and explained in these
pages. The method of attempting to reproduce little drawings was
used more than any other, simply because it proved the most convenient;
it could be done at a moment’s notice, and so fitted into
our busy lives. The procedure was varied in a few details to save
time and trouble, as I shall later explain, but the essential feature
remains unchanged: I make a set of drawings, and my wife takes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>them one by one and attempts to reproduce them without having
seen them. Here are a few samples, chosen at random because of
their picturesque character. If my wife wrote anything on the drawing,
I add it as “comment”; and you are to understand here, and
for the rest of this book, that “comment” means the exact words

<p class='c010'>Next, a series of three pairs, which, as it happened, were done
one after the other, numbers three, four and five in the twenty-third
series of my drawings. They are selected in part because
they are amusing. First, I tried to draw a bat, from vague memories
of boyhood days when they used to fly into the ball-rooms at Virginia
springs hotels, and have to be massacred with brooms, because
it was believed that they sought to tangle themselves in the
hair of the ladies (Figs. <a href='#fig_10'>10</a>, <a href='#fig_10a'>10a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>My wife’s comment on the above reads: “Big insect. I know
this is right because it moves his legs as if flying. Beetle working
its legs. Legs in motion!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And next, my effort at a Chinese mandarin (Figs. <a href='#fig_11'>11</a>, <a href='#fig_11a'>11a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>The comment reads: “More beetles, or legged bugs”—and
she draws the mustaches of the mandarin and his hair. “Head of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>dragon with big mouth. See also a part of his body—in front, or
shoulders” The association of mandarins with dragons is obvious.</p>

<p class='c010'>And finally, my effort at a boy’s foot and roller-skate, which
undergoes a strange telepathic transformation. I have put it upside
down for easier comparison (Figs. <a href='#fig_12'>12</a>, <a href='#fig_12a'>12a</a>):</p>

<p>Fig. 12a</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The comment, complete, reads: “Profile of head and neck
of animal—lion or dog—a muzzle. Maybe pig snout.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The above are samples of our successes. Altogether, of such
drawings, 38 were prepared by my secretary, while I made 252, a
total of 290. I have classified the drawings to the best of my ability
into three groups: successes, partial successes, and failures. The
partial successes are those drawings which contain some easily recognized
element of the original drawing: such as, for example, the
last one above. The profile of a pig’s head is not a roller skate, but
when you compare the drawings, you see that in my wife’s first
sketch the eyes resemble the wheels of the roller-skates, and in her
second sketch the snout resembles my shoe-tip; also there is a general
similarity of outline, which is what she most commonly gets.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>In the 290 drawings, the total of successes is 65, which is roughly
23 per cent. The total of partial successes is 155, which is 53 per
cent. The total of failures is 70, which is 24 per cent. I asked some
mathematician friends to work out the probabilities on the above
results, but I found that the problem was too complicated. Who
could estimate how many possible objects there were, which might
come into my head to be drawn? Any time the supply ran short,
I would pick up a magazine, and in the advertising pages find a
score of new drawings to imitate. Again, very few of the drawings
were simple. We began with such things as a circle, a square, a
cross, a number or a letter; but soon we were doing Chinese mandarins
with long mustaches, and puppies chasing a string. Each of
these drawings has many different features; and what mathematician
could count the number of these features, and the chances
of reproducing them?</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a matter to be judged by common sense. It seems to me
any one must agree that the chances of the twelve drawings so far
shown having been reproduced by accident is too great to be worth
considering. A million years would not be enough for such a set
of coincidences.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><em>3</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Much of the evidence which I am using rests upon the good
faith of Mary Craig Sinclair; so, before we go further, I ask your
permission to introduce her. She is a daughter of the far South;
her father a retired planter, bank president and judge, of Mississippi.
The fates endowed his oldest child with the blessings of
beauty, health, wealth and wisdom—and then spoiled it, by adding
a curse in the shape of a too tender heart. The griefs of other people
overwhelm Craig like a suffocation. Strangers take one glance at
her, and instantly decide that here is one who will “understand.”
I have seen her go into a store to buy a piece of ribbon, and come
out with tears in her eyes, because of a tragic story which some
clerk was moved to pour out to her, all in a moment, without provocation.
She has always said that she “gets” the feelings of people,
not by their words, but by intuition. But she never paid any attention
to this gift; never associated it with “psychic” matters. She
was always too busy, first with eight younger brothers and sisters,
and then with the practical affairs of an unpractical author-husband.</p>

<p class='c010'>Early in childhood, things like this would happen: her mother
would say to a little negro servant, “Go and find Miss Mary Craig”;
but before the boy could start, Craig would know that her mother
wanted her, and would be on the way. This might, of course, have
been coincidence; if it stood alone, it would have no value. But
the same thing happened with dreams. Craig dreamed there was a
needle in her bed, and woke up and looked for it in vain; in the
morning she told her mother, who slept in another room. The
mother said: “How strange! I dreamed the same thing, and I woke
up and really found one!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Of her young ladyhood, Craig told this story, one of many:
Driving with a girl friend, miles from home, she suddenly remarked:
“Let’s go home; Mr. B is there.” Now this was a place
to which Mr. B had never come; it was three hundred miles from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>his town. But Craig said: “I have just had an impression of him,
sitting on our front porch.” Going home, they found him there.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another instance, of more recent date. Shortly after our coming
to California, my wife all at once became greatly worried about
Jack London; she insisted that he was in terrible mental distress.
As it happened, George Sterling had told us much about Jack’s
troubles, but these were of old standing, and there was nothing
to account for the sudden notion which my wife took up on a certain
day. We had a lot of conversation about it; I offered to take
her to the London ranch, but she said she would not attempt to
meddle in the affairs of a married man, unless at his wife’s request.
I made the laughing suggestion that she go alone, in the guise of
a gypsy fortune-teller—a rôle which in her young ladyhood she had
played with social éclat. Two days later we read that Jack London
was dead, and very soon came letters from George Sterling, telling
us that he had taken his own life. This, again, might be coincidence;
if it stood alone I would attach no importance to it. But taken with
this mass of evidence, it has a share of weight.</p>

<p class='c010'>When we were married, seventeen years ago, we spent some
time in England, and there we met a woman physician, interested
in “mental healing,” and full of ideas about “psychic” things. Both
Craig and I were in need of healing, having been through a siege
of trouble. Craig was suffering with intense headaches, something
hitherto unknown in her life; while I had an ancient problem of
indigestion, caused by excess of brain work and lack of body work.
We began to experiment with healing by the “laying on of hands”—without
knowing anything about it, just groping in the dark. I
found that I could cure Craig’s headaches—and get them myself;
while she found that she could take my indigestion, a trouble she
had never known hitherto. Each of us was willing to take the other’s
pains, but neither was willing to give them, so our experiments
came to a halt.</p>

<p class='c010'>We forgot the whole subject for more than ten years. I was
busy trying to reform America; while Craig was of the most intensely
materialistic convictions. Her early experiences of evangelical
religion had repelled her so violently that everything
suggestive of “spirituality” was repugnant to her. Never was a woman
more “practical,” more centered upon the here and now, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>things which can be seen and touched. I do not go into details
about this, but I want to make it as emphatic as possible, for the
light it throws upon her attitude and disposition.</p>

<p class='c010'>But shortly after the age of forty, her custom of carrying the
troubles of all who were near her resulted in a breakdown of health.
A story of suffering needless to go into: suffice it that she had many
ills to experiment upon, and mental control became suddenly a
matter of life and death. In the course of the last five or six years
Craig has acquired a fair-sized library of books on the mind, both
orthodox scientific, and “crank.” She has sat up half the night
studying, marking passages and making notes, seeking to reconcile
various doctrines, to know what the mind really is, and how it works,
and what can be done with it. Always it was a practical problem:
things had to <em>work</em>. If now she believes anything, rest assured that
it is because she has tried it out in the crucibles of pain, and proved
it in her daily regimen.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was not content to see psychic phenomena produced by
other persons. Even though authorities warned her that trances
might be dangerous, and that <em>rapport</em> with others might lead to
dissociations of personality—even so, she had to find out for herself.
A hundred times in the course of experiments of which I am going
to tell, she has turned to me, saying: “Can you think of any way
this can be chance? What can I do to make it more sure?” When I
said, the other night: “This settles it for me. I am going to write
the story,” her reply was, “Wait a while!” She wants to do more
experimenting; but I think that enough is enough.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h3 class='c003'><em>4</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Two years ago Craig and I heard of a “psychic,” a young
foreigner who was astounding physicians of Southern California,
performing feats so completely beyond their understanding that
they were content to watch without trying to understand. We went
to see this young man, and befriended him; he came to our home
every day, and his strange demonstrations became familiar to us.
He had the ability to produce anaesthesia in many parts of his body,
and stick hatpins through his tongue and cheeks without pain; he
could go into a deep trance in which his body became rigid and
cold; and I put his head on one chair and his heels on another, and
stood in the middle, as if he were a two-inch plank. We have a
motion picture film, showing a 150-pound rock being broken with
a sledge-hammer on his abdomen while he lay in this trance. The
vital faculties were so far suspended in this trance that he could be
shut up in an airtight coffin and buried underground for several
hours; nor was there any hocus-pocus about this—I know physicians
who got the coffins and arranged for the tests and watched every
detail; in Ventura, California, it was done in a ball park, and a
game was played over the grave.</p>

<p class='c010'>In our home he gave what appeared to be a demonstration of
levitation without contact. I do not say that it really was levitation;
I merely say that our friends who witnessed it—physicians, scientists,
writers and their wives, fourteen persons in all—were unable even
to suggest a normal method by which the event could have happened.
There was no one present who could have been a confederate,
and the psychic had been searched for apparatus; it was in our
home, where he had no opportunity whatever for preparation. His
wrists and ankles were firmly held by persons whom I know well;
and there was sufficient light in the room so that I could see the
outline of his figure, slumped in a chair. Under these circumstances
a 34-pound table rose four feet into the air and moved
slowly a distance of eight feet over my head.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>We saw this; our friends saw it; yet, in my mind, and likewise
in theirs, the worm of doubt would always creep in. There are so
many ways to fool people; so many conjuring tricks—think of
Houdini, for example! I was unwilling to publish what I had seen;
yet, also, I was unwilling not to publish it—for think of the possible
importance of faculties such as this, locked up in our minds!
Here was my wife, ill, suffering pain; and these facilities might
perhaps be used in healing. If by concentration and auto-suggestion
it was possible for the mind to control the body, and put a veto
upon even a few of its disorders, certainly it was worth while for us
to prove the fact. I could not escape the moral obligation to probe
these matters.</p>

<p class='c010'>This “psychic” claimed also to possess and demonstrate the
power of telepathy, or mind-reading. He would go out of the room
while one of us selected mentally some object in the room, not
revealing the choice to any one else. The “psychic” would then
come back, and tell us to stand behind him and concentrate our
thoughts upon that object, and follow close behind him, thinking
of it. He would wander about the room for a while, and in the end
pick up the object, and do with it whatever we mentally “willed”
him to do.</p>

<p class='c010'>We saw him make this test not less than a hundred times, in
California, New York, and Boston; he succeeded with it more than
half the time. There was no contact, no word spoken, nothing that
we could imagine as giving him a clue. Did we unconsciously make
in our throats some faint pronunciation of words, and did the young
man have a super-acuity of hearing? Again, you see, the worm of
doubt, and we never could quite decide what we really believed
about this performance. After puzzling over it for a year or more,
my wife said: “There is only one way to be certain. I am going to
learn to do these things <em>myself</em>!”</p>

<p class='c010'>This young man, whom I will call Jan, was a peculiar person.
Sometimes he would be open and frank, and again he would be
mysterious and secretive. At one time he would agree to teach us
all he knew, and again he would hold on to his arts, which he had
had to go all the way to India to get. Was it that he considered these
forces too dangerous for amateurs to play with? Or was it merely
that he was considering his means of livelihood?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Jan was a hypnotist; and my wife had come to realize that all
illness is more or less amenable to suggestion. She had had the idea
of being hypnotized and given curative suggestions; but she did not
know enough about this stranger, and was unwilling to trust him.
After she got to know him better, her purposes changed. Here was
a fund of knowledge which she craved, and she put her woman’s
wits to work to get it. She told him to go ahead and hypnotize her—and
explained to me her purpose of trying to turn the tables on him.
Jan fixed his eyes upon hers in the hypnotic stare, and made his
magnetic passes; at the same time his patient stared back, and I sat
and watched the strange duel of personalities.</p>

<p class='c010'>An essential part of Jan’s technique, as he had explained it,
was in outstaring the patient and never blinking his eyes. Now suddenly
he blinked; then he closed his eyes and kept them closed. “Do
your eyes hurt?” asked his patient, in pretended innocence. “No,”
he replied. “Are you tired?” she asked. “No, thank you,” said he.
“What was I thinking?” she asked. “To hypnotize me,” he replied,
sleepily. But Craig wanted further proof, so she closed her eyes and
willed that Jan should get up and go to the telephone. “Shall I
go on treating you?” he asked. “Yes,” said she. He hesitated a
moment, then said, “Excuse me, I have to telephone to a friend!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I am telling about these matters in the order of time, as they
came to us. I am sorry that these stories of Jan come first, because
they are the strangest, and the least capable of proof. In the hope of
taking part of the onus from our shoulders, let me quote from a
book by Charles Richet, a member of the Institute of Medicine in
France, and a leading scientist; he is citing Pierre Janet, whose
name is known wherever in the world the human mind is studied.
The statement reads:</p>

<p class='c010'>“P. Janet, a most eminent French psychiatrist, and one of the
founders of the famous Salpetriere school of psychology in Paris,
and a careful and sceptical observer, has verified that a patient of
his, Leonie B., being put into hypnotic sleep by himself, or his
brother (from whom Leonie in her hypnotic sleep was unable to
distinguish him), could recognize <em>exactly</em> the substance that he
placed in his mouth—sugar, salt, pepper. One day his brother, J.
Janet, in an adjoining room, scorched his right arm above the wrist.
Leonie, who could have known nothing about it normally, gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>signs of real pain, and showed to P. Janet (who knew nothing of the
occurrence), the exact place of the burn.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Or let me cite the late Professor Quackenbos, of Columbia
University, who wrote many books on hypnotism as a therapeutic
agency, and tells of numerous cases of the same kind. He himself
would sometimes go involuntarily into hypnotic sleep with his
patient, and so, sometimes, would the nurse. Frequently between
the hypnotist and the subject comes what is called <em>rapport</em>, whereby
each knows what is in the other’s mind, and suggestions are
taken without their being spoken. You may believe this, or refuse
to believe it—that is your privilege. All I want to do is to make
clear that my wife is claiming no special achievement, but merely
repeating the standard experiences of the textbooks on this subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>This <em>rapport</em> between Craig and her protégé was developed to
such an extent that she could tell him what was in his mind, and
what he had been doing; she told him many stories about himself,
where he had been and what he had done at a certain hour. This
was embarrassing to a young man who perhaps did not care to have
his life so closely overseen; also, possibly, he was wounded in his
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amour propre</span></i>, that a mere amateur—and a woman at that—should
be coming into possession of his secret arts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The trick depends upon a process of intense concentration,
which will later be described in detail. After this concentration,
Craig would give to her subconscious mind the suggestion, or command,
that it should bring to her consciousness a vision of what Jan
was doing. This giving an order to the subconscious mind is much
the same sort of thing that you do when you seek to remember a
name; whether you realize it or not, you order your subconscious
mind to get that bit of information and bring it to you. Whatever
came to Craig, she would write it out, and when next she met Jan,
she would use her woman’s wits to verify it without Jan’s knowing
what was happening. At times it would be very amusing—when he
would find himself accused of some youthful misdemeanor which
his preceptress was not supposed to know about. In his efforts to
defend himself, he would fail entirely to realize the telepathic
aspects of the matter.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><em>5</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Please let me repeat, I am not telling here a set of fairy tales
and fantasies; I am presenting a record of experiments, conducted
in strict scientific fashion. All the results were set down day by
day in writing. For an hour or two every day for the past three years
my wife has been scribbling notes of her experiments, and there
are eight boxes full in her study, enough to fill a big trunk. No
statement in all the following rests upon our memories; everything
is taken from memoranda now in my hands. Admitting that new
facts can be learned about the mind, I do not see how any one can
use more careful methods than we have done.</p>

<p class='c010'>My wife “saw” Jan carrying a bouquet of flowers, wrapped in
white paper, on the street, and she wrote this down. She later
ascertained that at this hour Jan had carried flowers to a friend in
a hospital in Los Angeles, and she telephoned this friend and verified
the facts. On another occasion when Jan was in Santa Barbara,
a hundred miles from our home, she “saw” him escorting a blonde
girl in a blue dress from an auto to a hotel over a rainy pavement;
she wrote this down, and later ascertained that it had actually been
happening. The details were verified, not merely by Jan, but by
another member of the party. I ought to add that in no case did
my wife tell the other persons what she had “seen” until after these
persons had told her what had happened. No chance was taken of
their making up events to conform to her records. Always Craig
kept her cold-blooded determination to know what was <em>real</em> in this
field where so much is invented and imagined.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again, she “saw” Jan preparing to commit suicide, dressed in
a pair of yellow silk pajamas; then she “saw” him lying dead on the
floor. She was much disturbed—until Jan reminded her that he had
been seven times publicly “buried” in Southern California before
she met him. Several weeks later she learned that in one of these
“burials” he had worn yellow silk pajamas. Jan had forgotten this,
but Dr. Frank Sweet, of Long Beach, who had overseen the procedure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>remembered the pajamas, and how they had been ruined
by mud.</p>

<p class='c010'>Craig saw a vision of a bride, at a time when Jan, in his room
in a far part of the city, was awakening from sleep with a dream
about a friend’s wedding. On two occasions, while “concentrating,”
she got the impression that Jan and a friend of his had returned
unexpectedly from Santa Barbara to Hollywood. In both cases she
made careful record, and it turned out to be correct; I have a written
statement of the two young men, confirming the second instance,
and saying that it could not have been normally known to my wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have also a detailed record—some twenty pages long—of a
“clairvoyant” vision of Jan’s movements about the city of Long
Beach, including his parking of a car, carrying something over his
arm, visiting a barber-shop and a flower-shop, and stopping and
hesitating and then going on. The record includes a detailed
description of the streets and their lay-out, a one-story white building,
etc. Jan had been doing all this at approximately the time
specified. He had carried his trousers to a tailor-shop, with a barber-shop
directly opposite; he had stopped in front of a flower-shop and
debated whether to buy some flowers; he had taken a letter to be
copied by a typist, and had stopped on the street, hesitating as to
whether to wait for this copying to be done. All these details he
narrated to my wife <em>before</em> he knew what was in her written record.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another curious experience: I took Jan to the home of Dr.
John R. Haynes of Los Angeles, to give a demonstration of his mind-reading.
Jan said he felt ill, and would not be successful. Only one
or two of the tests succeeded. But meanwhile my wife was at home,
concentrating, and ordering her subconscious mind to show her
what Jan and I were doing. When I returned I found that she had
written a detailed description of Dr. Haynes’ home, including a
correct ground plan of the entrance hall, stairs and drawing-room,
and a description of the color and style of decorations, furniture,
lamps, vases, etc., in good part correct. Craig has never been in this
house.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jan goes into one of his deep states—a cataleptic trance, he calls
it—in which his body is rigid and cold. He has the power to fix in
advance the time when he will come out of the trance, and his
subconscious mind apparently possesses the power to keep track of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>time—days, hours, minutes, even seconds. I have seen him amaze
a group of scientists by coming out on the second, while they held
stop-watches on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>But now my wife thinks she will vary this procedure. Jan goes
into the trance in our home and Craig sits and silently wills, “Your
right leg will come out; you will lift it; you will put it down again.
You will sit erect”—and so on. Without speaking a word, she can
make him do whatever she pleases.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another incident, quite a long one. I ask you to have patience
with the details, promising that in the end you will see what it is all
about. I am in the next room, and I hear Jan and my wife having
one of their regular evening arguments, because he will not tell her
how he does this or that; at one moment he insists that he has told
her—and the next moment he insists that he does not know. My
wife finally asks him to concentrate upon an object in the room, and
she will see if she can “get” it. He selects the gas stove, in which a
fire is burning; and Craig says, “I see a lot of little flames.” Jan
insists that is “no good,” she didn’t get the stove; which annoys
her very much—she thinks he does not want to allow any success to
a woman. He is a “continental male,” something she makes fierce
feminist war upon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Craig is suffering from neuralgia in neck and shoulder, and
Jan offers to treat her. He will use what he calls “magnetism”; he
believes there is an emanation from his finger-tips, and so, with his
two forefingers he lightly traces the course of the nerves of her neck
and shoulder and arm. For ten or fifteen minutes his two fingers
are tracing patterns in front of her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then it is time for him to go home, and he is unhappy, and she
succeeds in drawing the explanation from him—he has to walk, and
his shoes are tight and hurt him. He has to have them stretched, he
tells her. She offers him a pair of my big tennis shoes to wear home,
and then she scolds him because he has the fashionable notion that
white canvas tennis shoes are not proper footwear for eleven o’clock
in the evening. Finally he puts them on and departs; and my wife
lies down and makes her mind a blank, and orders it to tell her
what Jan is doing.</p>

<p class='c010'>She has a pencil and paper, and presently she is writing words.
They are foreign words, and she thinks they must be in Jan’s native
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>language; they come drifting through her mind for several minutes.
Next day comes Jan for the daily lesson, and she shows him this
record. He tells her that the words are not in his language, but
German—which he knows, but never uses. My wife knows no
German; except possibly sauerkraut and kindergarten. But here
she has written a string of German and near-German words. I have
the original sheet before me, and I give it as well as I can make out
the scrawl: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">ei einfinen ein-fe-en swenfenz fingen sweizzen czie ofen
weizen ofen fingen swienfen swei fingern efein boden fienzen
meifen bogen feingen Bladen Meichen frefen eifein</span>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Some of this is nonsense; but there are a few German words in
it, and others which are guesses at German words, such as might be
made by a person hearing a strange language, and trying to set down
what he hears. Part of the effort seems to be concentrated on getting
one expression, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">zwe Fingern</span>”—two fingers! You remember the
two fingers moving up and down over Craig’s neck and shoulder!
And “Ofen”—the argument about the stove! And “bladen”—to
stretch shoes over a block of wood. Where these ideas came from
seems plain enough. But where did the German come from—unless
from the subconscious mind of Jan?</p>

<p class='c010'>A further detail, especially curious. Jan gave my wife the
meaning for the word “bladen”: “to stretch shoes over a block of
wood”; I have the memo which he wrote at the time. But looking
up the word in the dictionaries, I do not find it, nor can I find any
German who knows it. Apparently there is no such word; and this
would clearly seem to indicate that my wife got her German from
Jan. If so, it was by telepathy, for he spoke no word of it that
evening.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is the fashion among young ladies of the South to tease the
men; and Craig found in this episode a basis for tormenting her
psychic instructor. He had assured his patient that during the
treatment he was sending her “curative thoughts.” But what kind
of telepathic healer was it who sent gas-stoves and shoe-blocks into
a neuralgic shoulder? Jan, missing the humor, and trying to save
his reputation, declared that he hated the German language so
greatly, he did not even allow himself to think in it! Germany
was associated in his mind with the most painful memories, and
all that previous day he had been fighting depression caused by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>these memories. You see, in this blundering defense, a significant
bit of evidence. Jan had really had the German language in his
thoughts at the time Craig got them!</p>

<p class='c010'>I have before me a letter from Jan to my wife, postmarked
Santa Barbara, October 19, 1927. He says: “May these lovely
Cosmos bring you such peace and contentment as they have brought
me.” He has cut a double slit in the paper, and inserted cosmos
blossoms and violets. Prior to the receipt of this letter, my wife
was making the record of a dream, and here is what she wrote down:
“I dreamed Jan had a little basket of flowers, pink roses and violets,
shaped like this.” (A drawing.) “He lifted them up and said they
were for me, but a girl near him took them and said, ‘But I want
them.’” When Jan came to see us again, my wife asked about the
circumstance, and learned the following: a woman friend, who
had given Jan the flowers, had accused him of meaning to send
them to a girl; but he had answered that they were for “a middle-aged
and distinguished lady.”</p>

which met her eyes when she opened the young “psychic’s” letter a
day or two later. I explain that my wife’s drawing (Fig. <a href='#fig_13'>13</a>) is partly
written over by the words of her notes; while in Jan’s letter the
violets had to be at once traced in pencil, as they would not last. My
wife drew pencil marks around them and wrote the word “violet”
in three places, to indicate what the marks meant. The cosmos
flowers, pressed and dried, are still exactly as Jan stuck them into
position and as they remained until I took them to be photographed
(Fig. <a href='#fig_13a'>13a</a>).</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>As I have said, I hesitate to tell about incidents such as these.
They are hard to believe, and the skeptic may say that my wife
was hypnotized by Jan, and made to believe them. But it happens
that Craig has been able to establish exactly the same <em>rapport</em> with
her husband, who has never had anything to do with hypnosis,
except to watch it a few times. A Socialist “muck-raker,” much
wrapped up in his job, the husband sits and reads, or revises manuscript,
while the wife works her white magic upon his mind. Suddenly
his train of thought is broken by an exclamation; the wife
has “willed” him to do such and so—and he has done it! Or maybe
she has been asleep, and come out with the tail end of a dream, and
has written down what appears to be a lot of rubbish—but turns
out to be a reproduction of something the husband has been reading
or writing at that very moment! Hear one or two instances of
such events, all written down at the time.</p>

<p class='c010'>Colonel Lindbergh has flown to France, but Craig does not
know much about it, because she is not reading the papers, she is
asking, “What is life?” A year passes, and in the mail I receive a
monthly magazine, the <cite>Lantern</cite>, published by Sacco-Vanzetti sympathizers
in Boston. I open it, and find an article by a young radical,
assailing Lindbergh because he does not follow in his father’s footsteps;
his father was a radical congressman, but now the son allows
himself to be used by the army and navy people, and by the capitalist
press, to distract the minds of the masses from social justice. So
runs the charge; and before I am through reading it, my wife comes
downstairs from a nap. “What are you reading?” she asks, and I
answer: “Something about Lindbergh.” Says my wife: “Here are
my notes about a dream I just had.” She hands me a sheet of paper,
I have it before me now as I write, and I give it with misspelling
and abbreviations exactly as she wrote it in a hurry, not anticipating
that it would ever become public:</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I do not believe that Lindberg flew across the ocean in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>to take a ransome from a foreign gov as well as from his own. Nor
in order to induce the nations of the earth to a war in the air.’
Words which were in my mind as I awoke from nap on aft May 25.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I should add that my wife had had no opportunity to look
at the Boston magazine, whether consciously or unconsciously. She
tells me that Lindbergh had not been in her conscious mind for a
long time, and she had no remotest idea that the radicals were
attacking him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another instance: I am reading the latest “book of the month,”
which has just come in the mail, and to which my wife has paid no
attention. She interrupts me with a question: “Are there any
flowers in what you are reading?” I answer, “Yes,” and she says:
“I have been trying to concentrate, and I keep seeing flowers. I
have drawn them.” She hands me two drawings (Figs. <a href='#fig_14a'>14a</a>, <a href='#fig_14b'>14b</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>The book was Mumford’s <cite>Herman Melville</cite>, and I was at page
346, a chapter entitled, “The Flowering Aloe.” On this page are
six lines from a poem called “The American Aloe on Exhibition.”
On the preceding page is a discussion of the habits of this plant.
While my wife was making the left-hand drawing (Fig. <a href='#fig_14a'>14a</a>), I had
been reading page 344: “the red clover had blushed through the
fields about their house”; and “he would return home with a handful
of clover blossoms.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Of experiences like this there have been many. Important as
the subject is, I find it a bother, because I am called upon to listen
to long narratives of dreams and telepathy, while my mind is on
Sacco and Vanzetti, or the Socialist presidential campaign, or whatever
it is. Sometimes the messages from the subconscious are complicated
and take patience to disentangle. Consider, for example,
a little drawing (Fig. <a href='#fig_15'>15</a>)—one of nearly three hundred which this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>long-suffering husband has made for his witch-wife to reproduce
by telepathy: a football, you see, neatly laced up. In her drawing
(Fig. <a href='#fig_15a'>15a</a>) Craig gets the general effect perfectly, but she puts it on
a calf. Her written comment was: “Belly-band on calf.”</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 15a</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>While Craig was making this particular experiment, her husband
was reading a book; and now, wishing to solve the mystery,
she asks, “What are you reading?” The husband replies, wearily:
“DeKruif’s <cite>Hunger Fighters</cite>, page 283.” “What does it deal with?”
“It is a treatise on the feeding of cows.” “Really?” says Craig.
“Will you please write that down for me and sign it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>But why did the cow become a calf? That, too, is something
to be explained. Says Craig: “Do you remember what I used to tell
you about old Mr. Bebb and his calves?” Yes, the husband knows
the story of the half-crazy old Welshman, who thirty or forty years
ago was the caretaker of the Kimbrough summer home on the
Mississippi Sound. Old Mr. Bebb made his hobby the raising of
calves by hand, and turning them into parlor pets. He would teach
them to use his three fingers as a nursing bottle, and would make
fancy embroidered belly-bands for them, and tie them up in these.
So to the subconscious mind which was once little Mary Craig
Kimbrough of Mississippi, the idea of a calf sewed up like a football
is one of the most natural in the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since my wife and I have no secrets from each other, it does
not trouble me that she is able to see what I am doing. While I am
away from home, she will “concentrate” upon me, and immediately
afterwards write out what she “sees.” On one occasion she described
to me a little red book which I had got in the mail at the office.
By way of establishing just what kind of book she had “seen,” she
had gone to my bookcase and picked out a French dictionary—and
it happened that I had just received the Italian dictionary of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>same series, uniform in binding. On another occasion, while making
a study of dream-material, she wrote out a dream about being
lost in long and involved concrete corridors—while I was trying to
find my way through the locker-rooms of a Y. M. C. A. basement,
running into one blind passage after another, and being much annoyed
by doors that wouldn’t open.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dreams, you understand, are products of subconscious activity,
and to watch them is one method of proving telepathy. By practice
Craig has learned to lie passive, immediately after awakening, and
trace back a long train of dreams. Here is one of the results, a story
worth telling in detail—save that I fear you will refuse to believe it
after it is told.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the afternoon of January 30, 1928, I was playing tennis on
the courts of the Virginia Hotel, in Long Beach, California, and
my wife was taking a nap. She did not know that I was playing
tennis, and has no knowledge about the places where I play. She
takes no interest in the game, regarding it as a foolish business
which will some day cause her husband to drop dead of heart failure—and
she declines to be present on the occasion. When I entered
the house, she said: “I woke up with a long involved dream, and
it seemed so absurd I didn’t want to write it out, but I did so.”
Here are the opening sentences verbatim:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dreamed I was on a pier, watching a new kind of small, one
or two seated sport-boat, a little water car into which a woman got
and was shot by machinery from the pier out to the water, where
she skidded around a minute or two and was drawn back to the pier.
With us on the pier were my sister and child, and two young men
in white with white caps. These appeared to be in charge of this
new sport-boat. This boat is not really a boat. It is a sort of miniature
car. I’ve never seen anything like it. Short, so that only one
or two people could sit in it. An amusement thing, belonging to
the pier. The two young men were intensely interested, and stood
close together watching it out on the water,” etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c010'>Understand that this dream was not supposed to have anything
to do with me. It was before Craig had come to realize the
state of <em>rapport</em> with me; she had not been thinking about me, and
when she told me about this dream, she had no thought that any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>part of it had come from my mind. But here is what I told her
about my afternoon:</p>

<p class='c010'>The Virginia Hotel courts are close to what is called “The
Pike,” and there is an amusement pier just across the way, and on
it a so-called “Ferris wheel,” with little cars exactly like the description,
which go up into the air with people in them. That afternoon
it happened that the tennis courts were crowded, so my partner and
I waited out a set or two. We sat on a bench, in white tennis suits
and hats, and watched this wheel, and the cars which went up in
the air, and at a certain point took a slide on long rods, which made
them “skid around,” and caused the women in them to scream with
excitement. Underneath the pier was the ocean, plainly visible
along with the little cars.</p>

<p class='c010'>(Footnote, 1962: The hotel and the Pike no longer exist, so
do not waste your time trying to verify all this.)</p>

<p class='c010'>I should also mention the case of our friend, Mrs. Kate Crane-Gartz,
with whom there is a <em>rapport</em> which my wife does not tell her
about. My wife will say to me, “Mrs. Gartz is going to phone,” and
in a minute or two the phone will ring. She will say, “Mrs. Gartz
is coming. She wants me to go to Los Angeles with her.” Of course,
a good deal of guessing might be possible, in the case of two intimate
friends. But consider such guessing as this: My wife had a
dream of an earthquake and wrote it down. Soon thereafter occurred
this conversation with Mrs. Gartz. I heard it, and my wife
recorded it immediately afterwards, and I quote her written record:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mrs. Gartz dreamed of earthquake. ‘Wasn’t it queer that I
dreamed of swaying slowly from side to side.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I dreamed the same,’ I said. ‘But I was in a high building.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘So was I,’ she replied.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Craig calls attention to the word “slowly,” as both she and Mrs.
Gartz commented on this. They didn’t believe that an earthquake
would behave that way; but I pointed out that it would happen just
so with a steel-frame building.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><em>7</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>I come now to a less fantastic and more convincing series of
experiments; those made with the husband of my wife’s younger
sister, Robert L. Irwin. Eight years ago the doctors gave Bob only
a few months to live, on account of tuberculosis. Needless to say,
he has much time on his hands, waiting for the doctors’ clairvoyance
to be verified. He proved to be a good “subject”—the best of all in
the tests with Jan. One day in our home, a series of five tests were
made, with Bob holding an object in mind, while sitting several
feet away from Jan. The latter found the object, and made the correct
disposition of it, as willed by Bob, in four out of the five trials.
This included such unlikely things as picking up a striped blanket
and wrapping it about my shoulders.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bob and Craig made the arrangement that at a certain hour
each day, Bob, in his home in Pasadena, was to take pencil and paper
and make a drawing of an object, and sit and concentrate his mind
upon that drawing. At the same hour Craig, in our home in Long
Beach, forty miles away, was to go into her state of “concentration,”
and give orders to her subconscious mind to find out what was in
Bob’s mind. The drawings were to be dated, and filed, and when
the two of them met, they would compare the results, in the presence
of myself and Bob’s wife. If there should turn out to be a correspondence
between the drawings, greater than could be attributed
to chance, it would be evidence of telepathy, as good as any that
could be imagined or desired.</p>

<p class='c010'>The results were such as to make me glad that it was another
person than myself, so as to afford a disinterested witness to these
matters, so difficult of belief. I repeat that Bob is a young American
business man, priding himself on having no “crank” ideas; he has
had a Socialist brother-in-law for ten years or more without being
in the slightest degree affected in manners, morals, or convictions.
Here is his first drawing, done on a half sheet of green paper. The
word “CHAIR” underneath, and the date, were written by Bob,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>while the words “drawn by Bob Irwin” were added for purposes of
record by Craig (Fig. <a href='#fig_16'>16</a>):</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 16a</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>And now for Craig’s results. I give her report verbatim, with
the two drawings which are part of her text:</p>

<p class='c010'>“At 10 o’clock or a little before, while sewing (without effort)
I saw Bob take something from black sideboard—think it was the
glass candlestick. At 11:15 (I concentrate now) I saw Bob sitting
at dining room table—a dish or some small object in front of him
(on N. E. corner table). I try to see the object on table—see white
something at last. I can’t decide what it is so I concentrate on seeing
his drawing on a green paper as it is about 11:20 now and I think
he has made his drawing. I try hard to see what he has drawn—try
to see a paper with a drawing on it, and see a straight chair. Am
not sure of second drawing. It does not seem to be on his paper.
It may be his bed-foot. I distinctly see a chair like 1st on his paper.”
(Fig. <a href='#fig_16a'>16a</a>.)</p>

<p class='c010'>When Bob and my wife discussed the above test, she learned
that he had sat at the northeast corner of the table, trying to decide
what to draw, and facing the sideboard on which were silver candlesticks.
Later he went to his bedroom and lay down, gazing through
the foot of his bed at the chair which he had taken as his model for
the drawing. The bed has white bars running vertically, as in my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>wife’s second drawing. The chair, like Bob’s drawing, has the strips
of wood supporting the back running crossways, and this feature is
reproduced in Craig’s first drawing. Her report goes on to add
that she sees a star and some straight lines, which she draws; they
are horizontal parallel lines, as in the back of the chair. The back
of the chair Bob had looked at had a carved star upon it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second attempt was the next day, and Bob drew his watch
(Fig. <a href='#fig_17'>17</a>). Craig first drew a chair, and then wrote, “But do not
feel it is correct.” Then she drew the following (Fig. <a href='#fig_17a'>17a</a>):</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The comment was: “I see this picture. Later I think it is not
flower but wire (metal, shining). The ‘petals’ are not petals but
wire, and should be <em>uniform</em>. This is hasty drawing so not exact as
seen. What I mean is, I try to see Bob’s drawing and not what he
drew from. So I see no flower but shape of one on paper. Then decide
it is of wire, but this may be merely because I see drawing,
which would have no flower color. However, I see it shining as
if it is metal. Later a glass circle.” Drawings then show an ellipse,
and then a drinking glass and a glass pitcher. It is interesting to
note that Bob had in front of him a glass bowl with goldfish.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next day Bob drew a pair of scissors (Fig. <a href='#fig_18'>18</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>Three days later Bob drew the table fork, which has already
been reproduced (Fig. <a href='#fig_1'>1</a>), and Craig made the report which has
been given in facsimile (Fig. <a href='#fig_1a'>1a</a>): “See a table fork. Nothing else.”</p>

<p class='c010'>One more test between Bob and Craig, the most sensational
of all. It is quite a story, and I have to ask your pardon for the
medical details involved. So much vital knowledge hangs upon
these tests that I have asked my brother-in-law to forget his personal
feelings. The reader will please consider himself a medical student
or hospital nurse for the moment.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>The test occurred July 11, 1928. My wife made her drawing,
and then told me about the matter at once. Also she wrote out all
the details and the record is now before me. She saw a feather, then
a flower spray, and then she heard a scream. Her first thought in
case of illness or danger is her aged parents, and she took it for her
mother’s voice, and this so excited her that she lost interest in the
experiment. But soon she concentrated again, and drew a series
of concentric circles, with a heavy black spot in the center. Then
she saw another and much larger spot, and this began to spread and
cover the sheet of paper. At the same time came a feeling of intense
depression, and Craig decided that the black spot was blood, and
that Bob had had a hemorrhage. Here is her drawing (Fig. <a href='#fig_19a'>19a</a>):</p>

<div id='fig_19a'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 19a</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Two or three days later Bob’s wife drove him to our home,
and in the presence of all four of us he produced the drawing he
had made. He had taken a compass and drawn a large circle; making,
of course, a hole in the center of the paper. “Is that all you
thought of during the time?” asked my wife. “No,” said Bob, “but
I’d hate to have you get the rest of it.” “What was it?” “Well, I discovered
that I had a hemorrhoid, and couldn’t put my mind on anything
else but the thought, ‘My God, my lungs—my kidneys—and
now this!’”</p>

<p class='c010'>A hemorrhoid is, of course, apt to be accompanied by a hemorrhage;
and it seems clear that my wife got the mood of depression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>of her brother-in-law, his thoughts of blood and bodily breakdown,
as well as the circle and the hole in the paper. There is another
detail which does not appear in the written record, but is fixed in
my memory. My wife said: “I wanted to draw a little hill.” Upon
hearing that, I called up a physician friend who is interested in
these tests, and asked him what a drawing of a hemorrhoid would
look like, and he agreed that “a little hill” was about as near as
one could come. I hope you will note that this particular drawing
test is supported by the testimony of four different persons, my
wife, her sister, the sister’s husband, and myself. I do not see how
there could possibly be more conclusive evidence of telepathic
influence—unless you suspect all four of us of a series of stupid and
senseless falsehoods. Let me repeat that Bob and his wife have
read this manuscript and certified to its correctness so far as concerns
them. The comment written by my wife reads: “All this
dark like a stain—feel it is blood; that Bob is ill—more than usual.”</p>

<p class='c010'>(Note: Bob Irwin died not long afterwards.)</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h3 class='c003'><em>8</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The experiments just described were all that were done with
Bob, because he found them a strain. Craig asked me to make some
drawings for her, and I did so, sitting in the next room, some thirty
feet away, but always behind a closed door. Thus you may verify my
assertion that the telepathic energy, whatever it may be, knows no
difference between thirty feet and forty miles. The results with
Bob and with myself were about the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first drawings made with me are those which have already
been given (Figs. <a href='#fig_2'>2</a>, <a href='#fig_2a'>2a</a>), but I give them again for the sake of convenience.
I explain that in these particular drawings the lines have
been traced over in heavier pencil; the reason being that Craig
wanted a carbon copy, and went over the lines in order to make it.
This had the effect of making them heavier than they originally
were, and it made the whirly lines in Craig’s first drawing more
numerous than they should be. She did this in the case of two or
three of the early drawings, wishing to send a report to a friend. I
pointed out to her how this would weaken their value as evidence,
so she never did it again.</p>

<p class='c010'>After my wife and I had compared the above drawings, she
wrote a note to the effect that just before starting to concentrate, she
had been looking at her drawing of many concentric circles, which
she had made in a test with Bob the previous day (Fig. <a href='#fig_19a'>19a</a>). So her
first vision was of a whirl of circles. This turned sideways, and then
took the shape of an arrowhead, and then of a letter A, and finally
evolved into a complete star. As the agent in this test, I wish to
repeat that I made my drawing in my study with the door closed,
that I kept the drawing before my eyes the entire time, and that
the door stayed closed until Craig called that she was through.</p>

<p class='c010'>I do not find it easy to concentrate on a drawing, because my
active mind wanders off to side issues. If I draw a lighted cigarette,
I immediately think of the odious advertising now appearing in the
papers; or I think: “Will Craig get this right, and what does it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>mean, and will the world accept evidence on this subject from me?”—and
so on. Several times my wife has “got” such thoughts, and so
we took to noting them on the record. On July 29, I drew a cigarette,
with two little curls for smoke, each running off like a string
of the letter “eeeee,” written by hand. Underneath I wrote as
follows: “My thought: ‘cigarette with curls of smoke.’ I said to
myself these words: ‘she got the curls but not the cigarette.’” This
would appear to be telepathy coming from Craig to me, for her
drawing was found to contain a lot of different curves—a curly
capital S, several other half circles twisted together, and three ???
one inside the other. She added the following words: “I can’t draw
it, but curls of some sort.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Again, here is a work of art from my facile pen, dated July 21,
and having underneath my notation: “Concentrated on bald
head” (Fig. <a href='#fig_20'>20</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>My wife’s note was: “Saw Upton’s face.” Then she drew a line
through the words, and wrote the following explanation: “Saw
two half circles. Then they came together making full circle. But
I felt uncertain as to whether they belonged together or not. Then
suddenly saw Upton’s profile float across vision.”</p>

<p class='c010'>July 20 I drew a three-pronged fork, and made the note that I
was not sure if it was a hay-fork or an oyster-fork, and decided it was
the latter, whereupon my mind went off to “society” people and
their many kinds of forks. Craig wrote: “I thought it was an animal’s
head with horns and the head was on a long stick—a trophy
mounted like this”—and she drew a two-pronged fork.</p>

<p class='c010'>July 17 I drew a large round stone with a smaller stone on top:
at least so I thought, and then decided they were two eggs. Craig
drew two almost tangent circles, and wrote: “I see two round
things, not one inside the other, as in Bob’s drawing of circles. Then
the above vanished and I saw as below”—and she drew four little
oblongs, tangent, which might be a cluster of fish-eggs or fly-eggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>July 20 I drew two heavy straight lines making a capital letter
T, and Craig drew a complete cross or square X, which is, of course,
the T with vertical arm prolonged. July 14 I drew a sort of jack-lantern.
It is on next page (Fig. <a href='#fig_21'>21</a>). I looked at this drawing and
thought of the eyes of M.C.S., and said mentally, “I should have
drawn the curves over eyes.” Afterwards I told Craig about this,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>and she noted it down on the drawing. On the reverse side of the
sheet she added the following: “I told U. it was shaped like a half
moon with something in center—I supposed it must be a star,
though I did not see it as star but as indistinct marks.” Her drawing
follows, turned upside down for greater convenience (Fig. <a href='#fig_21a'>21a</a>):</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>A new method of experiment invented itself by accident;
and makes perhaps the strangest story yet. There came a letter from
a clergyman in South Africa, saying that he was sending me a copy
of his wife’s novel dealing with South African life. I get many letters
from strangers, and answer politely, and as a rule forget them
quickly. Some time afterwards came two volumes, entitled,
“Patricia, by Marcus Romondt,” and I did not associate them with
the clergyman’s letter. I glanced at the preface, and saw that the
work had something to do with the religious cults of the South
African natives. I didn’t read more than twenty lines—just enough
to classify the book as belonging in Craig’s department. Everything
having to do with philosophy, psychology, religion and medicine is
first read by her, and then fed back to me in her eager discourses.
I took the volumes home and laid them on her table, saying, “This
may interest you.” The remark attracted no special attention, for
the reason that I bring her a book, or a magazine, or some clippings
at least once a day. She did not touch these volumes, nor even glance
at the title while I was in the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>I went into the kitchen to get some lunch, and when it was
ready I called, “Are you going to eat?” “Let me alone,” she said,
“I am writing a story.” That also is a common experience. I ate
my lunch in silence, and then came into the living room again, and
there was Craig, absorbed in writing. Some time later she came to
me, exclaiming, “Oh, I have had the most marvelous idea for a
story! Something just flashed over me, something absolutely novel—I
never heard anything like it. I have a whole synopsis. Do you
want to hear it?” “No,” I said, “you had better go and eat”—for it
was my job to try to keep her body on earth. “I can’t eat now,” she
said, “I am too excited. I’ll read a while and get quiet.” So she
went to her couch, and there was a minute or two of silence, and
then an exclamation: “Come here!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Craig had picked up one of the two volumes from South
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Africa, and was staring at it. “Look at this!” she said. “Look what
I opened to!” I looked at a page in the middle of the book—she has
the devilish habit of reading a book that way—and in the center of
the page, in capital letters, I read the words: “THE BLACK
MAGICIAN.” “What about it?” I said. “Did you ever hear of that
idea?” asked Craig. I answered that I had, and she said, “Well, I
never did. I thought it was my own. It is the theme of the ‘story’
I have just been writing. I have made a synopsis of a whole chapter
in this book, and without ever having touched it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>So Craig had a new set of experiments to try all by herself,
without bothering her busy husband. She would go to one of my
bookcases, with which she had hitherto had nothing to do, since
her own books are kept in her own place. With her back to the
bookcase, she would draw a book, and take it to her couch and lie
down, placing the book upon her solar plexus, and taking every precaution
to make sure that it never came into her line of vision. Most
of the books, being new, were in their paper jackets, so there was
no lettering that could be felt with her fingers. This, you note, is
not a test of telepathy, for no human mind knew what particular
book Craig’s hand had fallen upon. If she could tell anything about
the contents of that book, it would appear to be clairvoyance, or
what is known as “psychometry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>My books are oddly varied in character. There are new novels,
and works of history, biography, travel and economics. In addition,
there are what I call “crank books”; the queerly assorted volumes
which are destined by donors all over the world to convert me to
vegetarianism, antivivisection, anarchism, Mormonism, Mohammedanism,
infanticide, the abolition of money, or the doctrine
that alopecia is caused by onanism. Believe me, the person who
sets out to guess the contents of the books that come to me in the
course of a month has his or her hands full!</p>

<p class='c010'>But Craig was able to do it. She did it on so many occasions
that she would sit and stare at me and exclaim, “Now what do you
make of <em>that</em>?” She would insist that I sit and watch the process, so
as to be able to state that she never had the book in her line of vision.
In my presence she picked out a volume, and, keeping it hidden
from both of us, she said, “I see a blue cover, with a rising sun and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>a bare landscape.” It happened to be a volume circulated by the
followers of “Pastor Russell,” and as the preface tells me that 1,405,000
have been sold, it may be that you too have it in your library.
The title is <cite>Deliverence</cite>, by J. F. Rutherford, and it has a blue
cloth cover, with a gold design of a sun rising behind a mass of
clouds and a globe.</p>

<p class='c010'>On another occasion Craig wrote: “One big eye, with nothing
else distinct—then lines or spikes came around it, or maybe these
project from the head like stiff long hairs, or eye-lashes. Can’t tell
what kind of head—but feel it must be a tropical something, tho
the eye looks human,” etc. The book was <cite>Mr. Blettsworthy on
Rampole Island</cite>, by H. G. Wells, and in this book is a chapter
headed, “The Friendly Eye,” with the following sentences: “I
became aware that an Eye observed me continually.... It was a
reddish brown eye. It looked out from a system of bandages that
also projected a huge shock of brown hair upward and a great chestnut
beard&nbsp;... the eye watched me with the illuminating but expressionless
detachment of a head-lamp.... Polyhemus, for that was
my private name for the man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A long string of such surprises! Craig picked up a book and
wrote: “Black wings—a vampire flying by night.” The title of
the book was <cite>The Devil’s Jest</cite>. She picked up one and wrote: “A
Negro’s head with a light around it.” It is a German volume, called
“Africa Singt,” and has a big startling design exactly as described.
She picked up a book by Leon Trotsky, and wrote the word
“Checkro”—which may not sound like Russian to Trotsky, but does
to Craig! And a book with Mussolini on the cover, wearing a black
coat and feeding a lion: she got the shape of the Duce’s figure, only
she labeled him “Black Bird.” And here is a part of the jacket
design of “wings” on the “Literary Guild” books—and below is
what Craig made of it. She added the comment: “Motion—the thing
is traveling, point first (Fig. <a href='#fig_22'>22</a>, 22a).”</p>

<div id='fig_22'  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Another volume was described as follows: “A pale blue book.
Lonely prairie country, stretch of flat land against sky, and outlined
against it a procession of people. Had feeling of moving—wheeled
vehicle which seemed to be baby-carriage. This was
strange, because country was covered with snow.” Upon examination,
the book proved to be bound in mottled pale blue boards,
title, “I’m Scairt,” with subtitle, “Childhood Days on the Prairies.”
On the first page of the preface occurs the following: “It was in
those days that a company of Swedes left their beloved homeland
in the far North and came to make a home for themselves and their
children on the Kansas prairie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Finally, I have obtained the publisher’s consent to reproduce
the jacket design of a recent book, so that I may put Craig’s telepathy
alongside it, and give you a laugh or two. Observe the jolly
little tourists, and what they have turned into! And then the efforts
of Craig’s subconscious mind at French. They taught it to her in
a “finishing school” on Fifth Avenue, and you can see that it was
finished before it began (Figs. <a href='#fig_23'>23</a>, <a href='#fig_23a'>23a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet another form of experiment invented itself under the
pressure of necessity. Impossible to have such a witch-wife without
trying to put her to use!</p>

<p class='c010'>I have the habit of working out a chapter of a new book in
my head, and writing down a few notes on a scrap of paper, and
sticking it away in any place that is handy; then, next day, or whenever
I am ready for work, it is gone, and there is the devil to pay.
I wander about the house for an hour or two, trying to imagine
where I can have put that scrap of paper, and reluctant to do the
work all over again. On one occasion I searched every pocket, my
desk, the trash-baskets, and then, deciding that I had dropped it
outdoors, where I work with my typewriter, I figured the direction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of the wind, and picked up all the scraps of paper I saw decorating
the landscape of our beach home. Then I decided it must be in a
manuscript which I had given to a friend in Los Angeles, and I
was about to phone to that friend, when Craig asked what the trouble
was, and said, “Come, let’s make an experiment. Lie down here,
and describe the paper to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I told her, a sheet off a little pad, written on both sides, and
folded once. She took my hand, and went into her state of concentration,
and said, “It is in the pocket of a gray coat.” I answered,
“Impossible; I have searched every coat in the house half a dozen
times.” She said, “It is in a pocket, and I will get it.” She got up
off the couch, and went to a gray coat of mine, and in a pocket I
had somehow overlooked, there was the paper! Let me add that
Craig had had nothing to do with my clothing in the interim, and
had never seen the paper, nor heard of it until I began roaming
about the house, grumbling and fussing. Neither of us know of
any “normal” way by which her subconscious mind could have
got this information.</p>

<p class='c010'>My secretary lost two screw-caps of the office typewriter, and
I said to my wife, “I will bring him over, and you see if you can
tell him where to look.” But my wife was ill, and did not want to
meet any one, so she said, “I will see if I can get it through you.”
Be it understood, Craig has not been in the office in a year, and
has met my secretary only casually. She said, “I see him standing
up at his typewriting.” That is an unusual thing for a typist to do,
but it happened to be true. Said Craig: “He has put the screw-caps
on something high. They are in the south room, above the level
of any table or desk.” I went to the phone to ask my secretary, and
learned that he had just found the screws, which he had put on
top of a window-sash in the south room.</p>

<p class='c010'>The third incident requires the statement that, a few months
back, while my wife was away, our home had been loaned to friends,
and I had camped at the little house which I was using as an office.
Some medical apparatus had been left there; at least I had a vague
impression that I had had it there, and I said, “I’ll go and look.”
Said Craig: “Let’s try an experiment.” She took my hand, and
told me to make my mind a blank, and presently she said, “I see it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>under the kitchen sink.” I went over to the office, and found the
object, not under the sink, but under the north end of the bathtub.
I took it back to the house, and before I spoke a word, my wife
said: “I tried to get you on the phone. I concentrated again, and
saw the thing and wrote it out.” She gave me a slip of paper, from
which I copy: “Down under something, wrapped in paper—on
N. side of room—under laundry tub on floor or under bath tub
on floor in N. corner.”</p>

<p class='c010'>You may say, of course, if you are an incurable skeptic: “The
man’s wife had been over to the office and seen the object; she had
been searching his pockets, and had seen the paper.” Craig is positive
that she did nothing of the sort; but of course it is conceivable
that she may have done it and then forgotten it. Therefore, I pass
on to a different and more acceptable kind of evidence—a set of
drawing tests, in which I watched and checked every step of the
proceedings at my wife’s insistence. Here again I am a co-equal
witness with her, and the skeptic has no alternative but to say that
the two of us have contrived this elaborate hoax, making nearly
three hundred drawings with fake reproductions, in order to get
notoriety, or to sell a few books. I really hope nobody will say that
is possible. Very certainly I could sell more books with less trouble
by writing what the public wants; and if I were a dishonest man,
I should not have waited until the age of fifty-one to begin such
a career.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Concerning these drawings, there are preliminary explanations
to be made. They were done hastily, by two busy people.
Neither is a trained artist, and our ability to convey what we wish
is limited. When I start on a giraffe, I manage to produce a pretty
good neck, but when I get to the body, I am disturbed to note it
turning into a sheep or a donkey. When I draw a monkey climbing
a tree, and Craig says, “Buffalo or lion, tiger—wild animal”—I have
to admit that may be so; likewise when my limb of a tree is called a
“trumpet,” or when Craig’s “wild animal” resembles a chorus girl’s
legs. I will let you see those particular drawings. Figure 24 is mine,

black beetle, which hardly sounds like a triumphant success; but
study the drawings, and you see that my black smoke happens to
be the shape of a beetle, while the two sides of the volcano serve
very well for the long feelers of an insect (Figs. <a href='#fig_25'>25</a>, <a href='#fig_25a'>25a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>The tests began with four series of drawings, 38 in all, made
by my secretary. Following these were 31 series drawn by myself,
comprising 252 separate drawings. Each drawing would be
wrapped in an extra sheet of paper, and sealed in a separate
envelope, and the envelopes handed to my wife when she was ready
for the tests. She would put them on the table by her couch, and
lie down, putting the first envelope, unopened, over her solar
plexus, covered by her hand. Her head would be lying back on
a pillow, eyes closed, and head at such an angle that nothing but
the ceiling could be seen if the eyes were open. A dim light to
avoid sense stimulation; enough light to see everything plainly.
When she had what she judged was the right image, she would
take a pad and pencil and make the drawing or write the description
of what she “saw.” Then she would open the envelope and
compare the two drawings, and number both for identification.</p>

<p class='c010'>This recording was, of course, an interruption of her passive
state, and made the task difficult. In a few cases she repeated a
number or forgot the number, and this leaves a chance for confusion.
I have done my best to clear up all such uncertainties, but
there is a margin of error of one or two per cent to be noted. This
is too small to affect the results, but is mentioned in the interest of
exactness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since I found the sealing of envelopes tiresome, and Craig
found the opening of them more so, we decided half way through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the tests to abandon the sealing, and later we abandoned the
envelopes altogether. We reasoned that acceptance of the evidence
rests upon our good faith anyhow, and all that any sensible reader
can ask is that Craig make sure of never letting a drawing get
within her range of vision. She was doing this laborious work to
get knowledge for herself, and she certainly made sure that she was
not wasting her own time.</p>

<p class='c010'>At present the practice is this: I make her a set of six or eight
drawings on little sheets of pad paper, and lay them face down
on her table, with a clean sheet of paper over them. She lies down,
and with her head lying back on the pillow and her eyes closed,
she reaches for one of the drawings, and slides it over and onto
her body, covered by her hand. It is always out of her range of
vision, even if the drawing were turned toward her eyes, which
it never is.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the comfort of the suspicious, let me add that the relaxing
of the conditions caused no change in the averages. In the first four
series, drawn by my secretary, and sealed by him in envelopes,
there were only five complete failures in thirty-eight tests, which
is thirteen per cent; whereas in the 252 drawings made by me there
have been 65 outright failures, which is nearly twice as large a
percentage. Series number six, which was carefully sealed up,
produced four complete successes, five partial successes, and no
failures; whereas series twenty-one, which was not put in envelopes
at all, produced no complete successes, three partial successes, and
six failures. Perhaps I should explain that by a “series” I mean
simply a group of drawings which were done at one time. It is my
custom to make from six to a dozen and when Craig has finished
with them, they are put into an envelope and filed away.</p>

<p class='c010'>I will add that Craig again and again begged me to sit and
watch her work, so that I might be able to add my testimony to
hers; I did so, watching tests both with envelopes and without,
and assure you she left no loophole for self-deception. There was
plenty of light to see by, and some of the most startling successes
were produced under my eyes. I will add that no one could take
this matter with more seriousness than my wife. She is the most
honorable person I know, and she has worked on these experiments
with rigid conscientiousness.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>
  <h3 class='c003'><em>11</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>I shall give a number of the successful drawings, and some
of the partial successes, but none of the failures, for these obviously
are merely waste. When I draw a cow, and my wife draws a star or
a fish or a horseshoe, all you want is the word “Failure” and then
you want to know the percentage of failures, so that you can figure
the probabilities. Failures prove nothing that you do not already
believe; if your ideas are to be changed, it is successes that will
change them.</p>

<p class='c010'>I begin with series three, because of the interesting circumstances
under which it was made. Late in the afternoon I phoned
my secretary to make a dozen drawings; and then, after dark, Craig
and I decided to drive to Pasadena, and on the way I stopped at
the office and got the twelve sealed envelopes which had been laid
on my desk. I picked them up in a hurry and slipped them into a
pocket, and a minute or two later I put them on the seat beside me
in the car.</p>

<p class='c010'>After we had started, I said, “Why don’t you try some of the
drawings on the way?” We were passing through the Signal Hill
oil-field, amid thunder of machinery and hiss of steam and flashing
of headlights of cars and trucks. “It will be interesting to see if
I can concentrate in such circumstances,” said Craig, and took one
envelope and held it against her body in the darkness, while I went
on with my job of driving. After a few minutes Craig said, “I see
something long and oblong, like a stand.” She got a pad and pencil
from a pocket of the car, and switched on the ceiling light, and
made a drawing, and then opened the envelope. Here are the pictures;
I call it a partial success (Figs. <a href='#fig_26'>26</a>, <a href='#fig_26a'>26a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>Then came a drawing of an automobile. Considering the
attendant circumstances, it was surely not surprising that Craig
should report it as “a big light in the end of a tube or horn.”
There were many such lights in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then a fourth envelope: she said, “I see a little animal or
bug with legs, and the legs are sticking out in bug effect.” When
she looked into the envelope, she was so excited that she tried to
get me to look—at forty miles an hour on a highway at night! Here
is the drawing, meant to be a skull and cross-bones, but so done that
a “bug with legs” is really a fair description of it (Fig. <a href='#fig_28'>28</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>After we arrived at our destination, my wife did some more
of the drawings, and got partial successes. On this telephone the
comment was: “Goblet with another one floating near or above it

<p class='c010'>Concerning the above my wife wrote: “See something that
suggests a garden tool—a lawn rake, or spade.” And for the next
one (Fig. <a href='#fig_31'>31</a>) she wrote: “A pully-bone”—which is Mississippi
“darky” talk for a wish-bone of a chicken. I don’t know whether
it means a bone that you pull, or whether it is Creole for “poulet.”
Here is what my secretary had drawn (Fig. <a href='#fig_31'>31</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>I had asked my secretary at the outset to make simple geometrical
designs, letters and figures, thinking that these would be
easier to recognize and reproduce. But they brought only partial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>successes; Craig would get elements of the drawing but would not
know how to put them together. There were seven in the first
series, and there is some element right in every one. An oblong
was drawn exactly, and then two fragments of oblongs added to it.
A capital M in script had the first stroke done exactly, with the
curl. A capital E in script was done with the curls left out.</p>

<p class='c010'>And the same with the second series. Here is a square—but you
see that the two halves of it are wandering about (Figs. <a href='#fig_32'>32</a>, <a href='#fig_32a'>32a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>A quite different story began when my secretary allowed his
imagination a little play. He knows that my wife lives in part on
milk, and he knows that she is particular about the quality, because
he has to handle the bills. So he has a little fun with her, and you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>see that immediately she gets, not the form, but the color and feeling
of it (Figs. <a href='#fig_34'>34</a>, <a href='#fig_34a'>34a</a>):</p>

<p>Fig. 34a</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The comment reads: “Round white foamy stuff on top like
soap suds or froth.” As she drinks her milk sour and whipped, you
see that its foaminess is a prominent feature.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then comes an oil derrick. We live in the midst of these
unsightly objects, and are liable to be turned out of house and
home by drilling nearby; moreover, I have written a book called
“Oil!” and the exclamation mark at the end has been justified by
the effect of it on our lives. My wife made a figure five with long
lines going out, and wrote: “I don’t know why the five should
have such a thing as an appendage, but the appendage was most
vivid, so there it is” (Figs. <a href='#fig_35'>35</a>, <a href='#fig_35a'>35a</a>):</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 35a</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>After she had opened the envelope and seen the original
drawing, the problem became, not why a figure five should have
an appendage, but why an oil derrick should have a figure five.
Craig puzzled over this, and then lay down and told her subconscious
mind to bring her the answer. What came was this: the
German version of my book, called “Petroleum,” has three oil
derricks on the front, and a huge dollar sign on the back of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>cover, and this was what Craig had really “seen.” She had looked
at this book when it arrived, a year or more back, and it had been
filed away in her memory. Of course, this may not be the correct
explanation, but it is the one which her mind brought to her.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>
  <h3 class='c003'><em>12</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>These drawing tests afford a basis for psycho-analysis, and
it is interesting to note some of the facts thus brought up from the
childhood of my wife. For example, fires! She was raised in the
“black belt,” where there are nine Negroes to one white, and the
former are still close to Africa. When Craig was a girl, a nurse in
the family, having been discharged, set fire to the home while the
adults were away, and the children asleep. Another servant, jealous
of an unfaithful husband, put her two babies into a barrel full of
feathers and burned them alive. Other fires occurred; so now, in
her home, Craig keeps an uneasy eye out for greasy rags, or overheated
stoves, or whatever else her fears suggest. When in these
drawing tests there has been anything indicating fire or smoke, she
has “got” it, with only one or two failures out of more than a dozen
cases. Sometimes she “got” the fire or smoke without the object;
sometimes she supplied fire or smoke to an object which might
properly have it—a pipe, for example. The results are so curious
that I assemble them together—a series of fire-alarms, as it were.</p>

<p class='c010'>You recall the fact that in one of the early drawing tests—those
in which, instead of giving the drawings to my wife, I sat in
my study and concentrated upon them—I drew a lighted cigarette,
and thought of the curls of smoke. Craig filled up her drawing
with curves, and wrote: “I can’t draw it, but curls of some sort.”
At this time the convention that “curls stood for smoke” had not
been established. But now, in the series drawn by my secretary,
appeared a little house with smoking chimney, and you will see
that my wife got the smoke better than the house (Figs. <a href='#fig_36'>36</a>, <a href='#fig_36a'>36a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>This apparently established in her mind the association of
curls with smoke. So when, in series six, I drew a pipe with smoke-curls,
my wife first drew an ellipse, and then wrote: “Now it begins
to spin, round and round, and is attached to a stick.” She then
drew (Figs. <a href='#fig_37'>37</a>, <a href='#fig_37a'>37a</a>):</p>

I realized that would be difficult, so I drew this instead (Fig. <a href='#fig_38'>38</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>So when, in series eleven, I drew the muzzle half of an old-style
cannon, Craig’s imagination got to work one drawing ahead of
time. She wrote: “Fire and smoke—smoke—flame,” and then drew
as follows (Fig. <a href='#fig_43a'>43a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>So much for fires, and things associated with fire. Now consider
another detail about life in the Yazoo delta, brought out in
the course of our psycho-analysis. In the days of Craig’s childhood,
poisonous snakes were an ever-present menace, and fear of them
had to be taught to children, and could hardly be taught too early.
There is a family story of a little tot crawling under the house
and coming back to report, “I see nuffin wiv a tail to it!” In the
swamps back of Craig’s summer home on the Mississippi Sound
I have counted a dozen copperheads and moccasins in the course of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>a half hour’s walk. Also, her father has some childhood complex
buried in his mind, which causes him to have a spell of nausea at
the sight of a snake. All this, of course, strongly affected the child’s
early days, and now it is in her mental depths. So when I drew a
hissing snake, just see the uproar I caused! She made no drawing,
but wrote a little essay. I give my drawing, and her essay following
(Fig. <a href='#fig_45'>45</a>):</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“See something like kitten with tail and saucer of milk. Now
it leaps into action and runs away to outdoors. Turns to fleeing
animal outdoors. Great activity among outdoor creatures. Know
it’s some outdoor thing, not indoor object—see trees, and a frightened
bird on the wing (turned sidewise). It’s outdoor thing, but
none of above seems to be <em>it</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In other words, little Mary Craig Kimbrough is back on the
plantation, seeing terror among birds and poultry, and not knowing
what causes it! Study the drawing, and you see that I got the action
of the snake, but didn’t get the coils very well, so they might be a
“saucer of milk”—and a sure-enough kitten’s tail sticking out from
it. Another childhood horror here! Craig was a fat little thing,
and she slipped and plumped down on her favorite pet kitten, and
exploded it.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The person whom we are subjecting to this process of psycho-analysis
has a strong color sense, and wanted to be a painter. So we
note that she “gets” colors and names them correctly. Here is my
drawing of what I meant to be a bouquet of pink roses (Figs. 46,
46a):</p>

<p class='c010'>Or take this case of a lobster. Craig’s comment was: “Gorgeous
colors, red and greenish tinges.” Apparently I had failed to
decide whether I was drawing a live lobster or a boiled one! My
wife wrote further: “Now it turns into a lizard, camelian,<a id='t66'></a> reds and
greens.” When she sees this about to be made public, she is embarrassed
by her bad spelling; but she says: “Please do not overlook
the fact that a chameleon is a reptile—and so is a lobster.” I dutifully
quote her, even though her zoology is even worse than her
spelling! (Figs. <a href='#fig_47'>47</a>, <a href='#fig_47a'>47a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>While we are on the “reptiles,” I include this menacing crab,
which may have got hold of little Mary Craig’s toe on the beach of
the Mississippi Sound (Fig. <a href='#fig_48'>48</a>):</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>For the crab, Craig made two drawings, on opposite sides of
the paper (Figs. <a href='#fig_48a'>48a</a>, <a href='#fig_48b'>48b</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>The comments on the above read: “Wings, or fingers—wing
effect, but no feathers, things like fingers instead of feathers. Then
many little dots which all disappear, and leave two of them, O O,
as eyes of something.” And then, “Streamers flying from something.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Another color instance: I drew the head of a horse, and Craig
drew a lot of apparently promiscuous lines, and at various places
wrote “yellow,” “white,” “blue,” “(dark),” and then a general description,
“Oriental.” Afterwards she said to me: “That looks like
a complete failure; yet it was so vivid, I can’t be mistaken. Where
did you get that horse?” Said I: “I copied it from a Sunday supplement.”
We got the paper from the trash-basket, and the page
opposite the horse contained what Craig described. We shall note
several other cases of this sort of intrusion of things I did not draw,
but which I had before me while drawing.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Also anything with metal or shine seems to stand a good chance
of being “got.” For example, these nose-glasses (Figs. <a href='#fig_49'>49</a>, <a href='#fig_49a'>49a</a>):</p>

(Figs. <a href='#fig_50'>50</a>, <a href='#fig_50a'>50a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>She has got at least part of a watch whenever one has been
presented. You remember the one Bob drew (Fig. <a href='#fig_17'>17</a>). There was
another in series thirty-three; Craig made a crude drawing and
added: “Shines, glass or metal” (Figs. <a href='#fig_52'>52</a>, <a href='#fig_52a'>52a</a>):</p>

<div id='fig_52'  class='figleft id003'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Also, on<a id='t69'></a> the automobile ride to Pasadena, series three, there
was a watch-face among the drawings, and Craig drew the angle of
the hands, and added the words, “a complication of small configurations.”
Having arrived in Pasadena, she took the twelve drawings
and tried them over again. This time, of course, she had a one in
twelve chance of guessing the watch. She wrote: “A white translucent
glimmering, or shimmering which I knew was not light but
rather glass. It was like heat waves radiating in little round pools
from a center.... Then in the center I saw a vivid black mark....
So it was bound to be the watch, and it was.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And here is a fountain. You see that it appears to be in a tub,
and is so drawn by Craig. But you note that the “shine” has been
got. “These shine!” (Figs. <a href='#fig_53'>53</a>, <a href='#fig_53a'>53a</a>):</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Another instance, even more vivid. I made a poor attempt to
draw a bass tuba, as one sees them on the stage—a lot of jazz musicians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>dressed up in white duck, and a row of big brass and nickel
horns, polished to blind your eyes. See what Craig drew, and also
what she wrote (Figs. <a href='#fig_54'>54</a>, <a href='#fig_54a'>54a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>The comments, continued on the other side of the sheet, are:
“Dull gold ring shimmers and stands out with shadow behind it
and in center of it. Gleams and moves. Metal. There is a glow of
gold light, and the ring or circle is out in the air, suspended, and
moves in blur of gold.”</p>

<p class='c010'>You see, she gets the feeling, the emotional content. I draw a
child’s express-wagon, and she writes: “Children again playing but
can’t get exactly how they look. Just feel there are children.” Or
take this one, which she describes as “Egyptian.” I don’t know if
my pillar is real Egyptian, but it seems so to me, and evidently to
my wife, for you note all the artistry it inspired (Figs. <a href='#fig_55'>55</a>, <a href='#fig_55a'>55a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes Craig will embody the feeling in some new form
of her own invention; as for example, when I draw an old-fashioned
cannon on wheels, and she writes: “Black Napoleon hat and red
military coat.” I draw a running fox—well drawn, because I copy
it from a picture; she rises to the occasion with two crossed guns,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>and a hunting horn with a lot of musical notes coming out of it
(Figs. <a href='#fig_56'>56</a>, <a href='#fig_56a'>56a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>I draw an auto, and she replies with the hub and spokes of a
wheel. Not satisfied with this, she sets it aside, and tries again a
little later—without looking at the original drawing—and this time
she produces a horn, with indication of a noise. I give both her
drawings, which are on two sides of the same slip of paper (Figs.
57a, 57b):</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><em>14</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>An extraordinary incident occurred in connection with the
fourth series of drawings. While my secretary, E. M. Hart, was
making the drawings, there came into the office his brother-in-law,
R. H. Craig, Jr., a teller of the Security First National Bank of Long
Beach, a person entirely unknown to my wife. He heard what was
going on, and said, “I’ll give her some that’ll stump her.” He took
a pen and drew two pictures, which were duly wrapped in sheets of
green paper and sealed in envelopes, and put with the rest of the
series. I was not at the office, and nothing was said to me about
Mr. Craig having taken part in the matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>My wife did this series under my eyes; and when she came to
the first of Mr. Craig’s two drawings, she wrote, “Some sort of grinning
monster,” and added an elaborate description. Then she
opened the envelope, and found a roller skate with a foot and leg
attached. This, naturally, was called a failure; but seven drawings
later in the same series came Mr. Craig’s other drawing, which was
as follows (Fig. <a href='#fig_58'>58</a>):</p>

<div id='fig_58'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_072.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 58</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Now read the amazing description which my wife had written,
seven drawings back, when the first of Mr. Craig’s drawings had
come under her hand:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some sort of grinning monster—see only the face and a vague
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>idea of deformed neck and shoulders. It is a man, but it looks like
a cat’s face, cat eyes and whiskers. Don’t know just how I know it
is a man—it is a deformity. Not a cat. See color of skin which is
deep, flat pink, as of a colored picture. The face of the creature is
broad and weird. The flesh of neck, or somewhere, gives effect of
rolls or creases.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I asked my secretary what this drawing was meant to be, and
he said “a Happy Hooligan.” My cultural backwardness is such
that I wasn’t sure just what a “Happy Hooligan” might be, but my
secretary told me it is a comic supplement figure, and I then looked
it up in the paper, and found that the face of the figure as printed
is a very pale pink, and the little cap on top is a bright red. I called
Mr. Craig on the phone and asked him this question: “If you were
to think of a color in connection with a ‘Happy Hooligan,’ what
color would it be?” He answered, “Red.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Now I ask you, what chance do you think there is of a person’s
writing a description such as the above by guess work? To be sure,
my wife had eight guesses; but do you think that eight million
guesses would suffice? And if we call it telepathy, do we say that
my wife’s mind has the power to dip into the mind of a young man
whom she has never seen, nor even heard of? Or shall we say that
his mind affected his brother-in-law’s, the brother-in-law’s affected
mine, and mine affected my wife’s? Or, if we decide to call it clairvoyance,
or psychometry, then are we going to say there is some
kind of vibration or emanation from Mr. Craig’s drawing, so powerful
that when one of his drawings is handed to my wife, she gets
what is in another drawing which has been done at the same time?</p>

<p class='c010'>Whatever may be the explanation, here is the fact: Again and
again we find Craig getting, not the drawing she is holding under
her hand, but the next one, which she has not yet touched. When
she picks up the first drawing, she will say, or write: “There is a
little man in this series”; or: “There is a snow scene with sled”; or:
“An elephant, also a rooster.” I am going to show you these particular
cases; but first a word as to how I have counted such “anticipations.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Manifestly, if I grant the right to more than one guess, I am
increasing the chances of guesswork, and correspondingly reducing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>the significance of the totals. What I have done is this: where such
cases have occurred, I have called them total failures, except in a
few cases, where the description was so detailed and exact as to be
overwhelming—as in the case of this “Happy Hooligan.” Even so,
I have not called it a complete success, only a partial success. In
order to be classified as a complete success, my wife’s drawing must
have been made for the particular drawing of mine which she had
in her hand at that time; and throughout this account, the reader
is to understand that every drawing presented was made in connection
with the particular drawing printed alongside it—except in
cases where I expressly state otherwise.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now for a few of the “anticipations.” In the course of series
six, drawn by me on Feb. 8, 1929, drawing number two was a daisy,
and Craig got the elements of it, as you see (Figs. <a href='#fig_59'>59</a>, <a href='#fig_59a'>59a</a>):</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 59a</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Her mind then went ahead, and she wrote, “May be snow
scene on hill and sled.” The next drawing was an axe, which I give
later (Fig. <a href='#fig_145'>145</a>); she got the elements of this very well, and then
added on the back: “I get a feeling again of a snow scene to come
in this series—a sled in the snow.” That was number three; and
when number five came Craig made this annotation: “Opened it
by mistake, without concentrating. It’s my expected sled and snow
scene.” Here is the drawing (Fig. <a href='#fig_60'>60</a>):</p>

<p>Fig. 60</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Series number eight, on Feb. 10, brought even stranger results.
This is the series in which the laced-up football was turned into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>calf wearing a belly-band (Figs. <a href='#fig_15'>15</a>, <a href='#fig_15a'>15a</a>). But even while I was
engaged in making the drawings, sitting in my study apart, and
with the door closed, Craig’s busy magic, whatever it is, was bringing
her messages. She called out: “I see a rooster!” I had actually
drawn a rooster; but of course I made no reply to her words. She
at once drew a rooster and several other things, and after I had
brought my drawings into the room, but before she had started to
work with them, she wrote as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“While Upton was making these drawings I sat before the fire
thinking how to dry felt slippers which I had washed. I had my
mind on them. Hung them on grating to see if they would hang
there without burning. Suddenly saw rooster crowing. Then
thought, ‘Can U be drawing rooster?’ Decided to make note of this.
Did so. Then saw”—and she draws a circle with eight radiating
lines, like spokes of a wheel.</p>

<p class='c010'>In due course came drawing number eight, and before looking
at it, Craig wrote: “Rooster.” Then she added, “But no—it looks
like a picture of coffee-pot—see spout and handle.” This is hard
on me as an artist, but I give the drawing and let you judge for
yourself (Fig. <a href='#fig_61'>61</a>):</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 61</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>What about the circle and the radiating spokes? That was,
apparently, a fore-glimpse of drawing number five. I give you that,
together with what Craig drew for that particular test when it came.
Her effort suggests the kind of humor with which the newspaper
artists used to delight my childhood; a series of drawings in which
one thing turns into some other and quite unexpected thing by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>gradual changes. You will see here how the hub of a wagon-wheel
may turn into the muzzle of a deer! (Figs. <a href='#fig_62'>62</a>, <a href='#fig_62a'>62a</a>):</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>What are the principles upon which I have classified the
drawings, as between success, partial successes, and failures? I will
use this series, number eight, to illustrate. There are eight drawings,
and I have set them down as one success, six partial successes,
one failure. The success is the rooster (Fig. <a href='#fig_61'>61</a>), called “a rooster,”
even though it “looks like a coffee pot.” The partial successes are,
first, an electric light bulb, very crudely imitated as to shape in
three drawings. Perhaps this was hardly good enough to be counted;
it was a border-line case, and probably the poorest that I admitted
to the classification of “partial successes” (Fig. <a href='#fig_63a'>63a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Second, the ascending sky-rocket, already printed as fig. 38,
giving rise to six different drawings of whirligigs and light. Third,
the following drawing, for which Craig wrote: “See spider, or some
sort of legged pest. If this is not a spider, there is a spider in the lot
somewhere! This I know!” (Fig. <a href='#fig_64'>64</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>The fourth partial success was a drawn bow, with arrow fitted,
ready to be launched. Craig wrote as follows: “Picked this up and
saw inside as it dropped on floor—so did not try it. Suddenly recall
I have already ‘seen’ it earlier.” Before starting the tests, along with
her written mention of “a rooster,” she had drawn a bow and crude
arrow, and the resemblance is so exact that it seems to me entitled
to be called a partial success (Figs. <a href='#fig_65'>65</a>, <a href='#fig_65a'>65a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>Fifth, the wagon hub (Fig. <a href='#fig_60'>60</a>), which became the deer’s muzzle.
And finally the laced-up football (Fig. <a href='#fig_15'>15</a>) which became a belly-band
on a calf (Fig. <a href='#fig_15a'>15a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>As for the failure in this series, it is a cake of soap, which was
called “whirls.” There are a couple of other drawings in the series,
marked: “Too tired to see it,” and “Tired now and excited and
keep seeing old things”—meaning, of course, the preceding drawings.</p>

<p class='c010'>I tried to avoid drawing the same object more than once, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>now and then I slipped up. In series eleven I drew another rooster,
and there followed, not one “anticipation,” but several. Drawing
number one was a tooth; Craig wrote: “First see rooster. Then
elephant.” Drawing number two was an elephant; and Craig wrote:
“Elephant came again. I try to suppress it, and see lines, and a spike
sticking some way into something.” She drew it, and it seems clear
that the “spike” is the elephant’s tusk, and the head of the “spike”
is the elephant’s eye (Figs. <a href='#fig_66'>66</a>, <a href='#fig_66a'>66a</a>):</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Next, number three, was the rooster. But Craig had set
“rooster” down in her mind as a blunder, so now she wrote: “I don’t
know what, see a bunch, or tuft clearly. Also a crooked arm on a
body. But don’t feel that I’m right.” Here are the drawings, and
you can see that she was somewhat right (Figs. <a href='#fig_67'>67</a>, <a href='#fig_67a'>67a</a>):</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This series eleven, containing fourteen drawings, is marked:
“Did this lot rapidly, without holding (mind) blank. The chicken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and elephant came <em>at once</em>, on a very earnest request to my mind to
‘come across.’” I have classified in this series two successes, five
partial, and five failures: throwing out numbers twelve and fourteen,
because Craig wrote: “Nothing except all the preceding ones
come—too many at once—all past ones crowding in memory”; and
again, “Nothing but everything in the preceding. Too many of
them in my mind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The anticipations run all through this series in a quite fascinating
way. Thus, for number four Craig wrote: “Flower. This is
a vivid one. Green spine—leaves like century plant.” She drew
Figure 68a:</p>

<div id='fig_68a'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_080.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 68a</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>And then again, for drawing number seven, she did more
flowers, with this comment: “This is a <em>real</em> flower, I’ve seen it
before. It’s vivid and returns. Century plant? Now it turns into
candle stick. See a candle” (Fig. <a href='#fig_69a'>69a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>All this was wrong—so far. Number four was a table, and
number seven was the rear half of a cow. But now we come to
number eleven, the plant known as a “cat-tail,” which seems to
resemble rather surprisingly the lower of the two drawings in Figure
69a. My drawing is given as Figure 70, and the one Craig made for
it is given as 70a.</p>

<p class='c010'>Comment on the above read: “Very pointed. Am not able to
see what. Dog’s head?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Drawing five was a large fish-hook; and this inspired the
experimenter to a discourse, as follows: “Dog wagging—see tail in
air busy wagging—jolly doggie—tail curled in air.” And then:
“Now I see a cow. I fear the elephant and chicken got me too sure
of animals. But I see these.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, a big fish-hook looks not unlike a “tail curled in air.”
But when we come to number seven, we discover what Craig was
apparently anticipating. It is the drawing of what I have referred to
as “the rear half of a cow.” It is badly done, with a cow’s hoof, but I
forgot what a cow’s tail is like, and this tail that I drew would fit
much better on a “jolly doggy,” you must admit (Fig. <a href='#fig_71'>71</a>):</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Drawing number six was a sun, as children draw it, a circle
with rays going out all round. Craig wrote: “Setting sun and bird
in sky. Big bird on wing—seagull or wild goose.” This I called a
partial success. Number nine was the muzzle end of an old-style
cannon, already reported in Figures 46, 46a.</p>

<p class='c010'>I conclude the study of this particular series with drawing
thirteen, to which was added the comment: “Think of a saucer,
then of a cup. It’s something in the kitchen. Too tired to see”
(Figs. <a href='#fig_72'>72</a>, <a href='#fig_72a'>72a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>In series thirty-five I first drew a fire hydrant, and Craig wrote,
“Peafowl,” and added the following drawing, which certainly constitutes
a partial success (Figs. <a href='#fig_74'>74</a>, <a href='#fig_74a'>74a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>My next drawing was the peafowl, as you see. For this Craig
wrote: “Peafowl again,” and apparently tried to draw the peafowl’s
neck, and a lot of those spots which I had forgotten are an appurtenance
of peafowls (Figs. <a href='#fig_75'>75</a>, <a href='#fig_75a'>75a</a>):</p>

upside down, as I have done here, it looks like water and smokestacks.
Anyhow, Craig drew a steamboat (Figs. <a href='#fig_76'>76</a>, <a href='#fig_76a'>76a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>Then came an obelisk, and Craig got it, but with novel effects,
thus (Figs. <a href='#fig_79'>79</a>, <a href='#fig_79a'>79a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>Now why should an obelisk go on a jag, and have little circles
at its base? The answer appears to be: it inherited the curves from
the previous fish-hook, and the little circles from the next drawing.
You will see that, having used up her supply of little circles, Craig
did not get the next drawing so well (Figs. <a href='#fig_80'>80</a>, <a href='#fig_80a'>80a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>In series twenty-two I first drew a bed, and Craig made two
attempts to draw a potted plant. My second drawing was a maltese
cross, and Craig turned it into a basket (Figs. <a href='#fig_81'>81</a>, <a href='#fig_81a'>81a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>But she could not give up her plant. She added: “There is a
flower basket in this lot, or potted plant.” The next drawing was
a fleur-de-lis, which looks not unlike a potted plant or hanging
basket (Fig. <a href='#fig_82'>82</a>):</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>In drawing four she got the elements of a door-knob pretty
well, and added: “See head of bird, too—eagle beak.” Drawing
seven was a crane, with beak open.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>
  <h3 class='c003'><em>16</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>I could go through all thirty-five of the series, listing such
“anticipations” as this: but I have given enough to show how the
thing goes. Such occurrences make it hard for Craig because, when
she has once drawn a certain object, she naturally resists the impulse
to draw it again, thinking it is nothing but a memory. Thus, in
series thirteen, my first drawing was a savage woman carrying a
bundle on her head, and Craig drew the profile of a head with a long
nose. My next drawing was the profile of a head, with a very conspicuous
nose, and Craig wrote: “Face again, but [I] inhibit this.
Then come two hands, and below”—and she draws what might be
a cross section of a skull, side view.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet sometimes she overcomes this handicap triumphantly. Series
twelve is marked: “Hastily done,” and she adds the general
comment: “Several times saw bristles on things of different shapes,
some flowers, some bristled brushes. Saw flower, also more than
once”—and then she appends a drawing of a four-leaf clover. As it
happened, this series contained a three-leaf clover, and it contained
another flower, and also a cactus-plant—more of one kind of thing
than it was fair to put into one set of drawings. Nevertheless, Craig
scored one of her successes with the cactus, setting it down as “fuzzy
flower” (Figs. <a href='#fig_83'>83</a>, <a href='#fig_83a'>83a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor was she afraid to repeat herself when she came to another

<p class='c010'>Frequently she will make a good drawing of an object, but
name it badly. In that same series twelve I drew a hoe, and she got
the shape of it, but wrote: “May be scissors, may be spectacles with
long stem ears” (Figs. <a href='#fig_85'>85</a>, <a href='#fig_85a'>85a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>Craig’s verbal description of the above reads: “Stone set in
platinum; may be diamond, as points seem to be white light—at
least it shines, not red shine of fire but white shine.” How does
a stalk of celery, which looks like a fish-fork, come to have a diamond
set in it? You may understand the reason when you hear
that three drawings later in the same series is a diamond set in a
stick. Just why it occurred to me to set a diamond thus I cannot
now recall, but the drawing is plain, and it led to a bit of fun. I
had been to lunch with Charlie Chaplin that day, and had come
home and told my wife about it; so here my sparkling diamond
undergoes a transfiguration! “Chaplin,” writes my wife, and adds:
“I don’t see why he has on a halo” (Figs. <a href='#fig_89'>89</a>, <a href='#fig_89a'>89a</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>From the point of view of bad guessing, the most conspicuous
series is number twenty. In this I have recorded four successes,
seven partial, and one failure; yet there is hardly an object that
is correctly named. Here are the three which I call successes; there
may be dispute about any one of them, but it seems to me the
essential elements have been got. You may be surprised at a necktie

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>I have referred to the fact that my wife’s drawings sometimes
contain things which are not in mine, but which were in my mind
while I was making them, or while she was “concentrating.” One
of the most curious of such cases came in series twenty-eight, which
was after we had given up, as too great a nuisance, all precautions
in the way of sealing the drawings in envelopes. I made eight
drawings, and laid them face down on my wife’s table, and then
went out and took a walk while she did them. So, of course, it
was easy for her to do what she pleased—and maybe she “peeked,”
the skeptic will say. But as it happens, she didn’t get a single one
right! Instead of reproducing my drawings, what she did was to
reproduce my thoughts while I was walking up and down on the
ocean front. It seems to me that in so doing, she provided a perfect
answer to those who may attribute these results to any form
of deception, whether conscious or unconscious.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a moon behind a bank of dark clouds, and it produced
an unusual effect—a well-defined white cross in the sky. I
watched it for nearly half an hour, and my continued thought was:
“If this were an age of superstition, that would be a portent, and
we should hear about it in history.” It was so strange that I finally
went home and called my wife out onto the street. I did not tell
her why. I wanted to see her surprise, so I purposely gave no hint.
I said: “Come out! Please come!” Finally she came, and her comment
was: “I just drew that!” We went back into the house, and
she handed me a drawing. I give it alongside my drawing of an
Indian club, which Craig had held while doing hers. You may see
exactly how much of her impulse came from that source (Figs. 99,
99a):</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>The “comment” reads: “Light ‘fingers’—moonlight.” Also:
“black shadow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Let me add also that in the eight drawings I handed to Craig
there was neither moon, cloud, cross, nor light. Two of these eight
my wife failed to mark, and so I cannot identify them as belonging
to this series; but we examined all eight at the time, and made
sure of this point. Those which I now have are a flag, a bearded
man, a chiffonier, a cannon, a dirt-scraper, and the Indian club,
given above.</p>

<p class='c010'>You will ask, perhaps, did Craig look out of the window. As
it happened, this sky effect was invisible from any window, and I
have her word that she had not moved from her couch. I should
add that she is nervous, and keeps the curtains tightly drawn at
night, and never goes out at night unless it is to be driven somewhere.
It was early in March, with a cold wind off the sea, and I
had to labor to persuade her to put a wrap over her dressing gown
and step out into the middle of the street to look up at the sky.</p>

<div>

  <h3 class='c003'><em>18</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The casual reader may be bored by too many of these drawings,
but they are easy to skip, or to take in at a glance, and there
may be students who will want to examine them carefully. So I
will add a selection of the significant drawings, with only brief
remarks. I begin with what I have called partial successes, and
then add a few more of those I have called “complete.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Let us return to the early drawings, made by my secretary. On
the automobile ride to Pasadena, there was an ash-can (Fig. <a href='#fig_100'>100</a>):</p>

<p class='c010'>The comments accompanying these drawings read: “All I’m
sure of is a straight line with something curved at end of it; once
it came” (here is drawing of the flower). “Then it doubled, or reappeared,
I don’t know which. (Am not sure of curly edges.) Then
it was upside down.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The next drawing was a heart, and my wife got the upper half
with what are apparently blood-drops added (Figs. <a href='#fig_105'>105</a>, <a href='#fig_105a'>105a</a>):</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The above is interesting, as suggesting that whatever agency
furnished the information knew more than it was telling. For if
Craig’s drawing, a pair of curves, constituted a crude letter N, or
had no significance, why add the blood-drops, which were not in
the original? On the other hand, if her subconscious mind knew it
was a heart, why not give her the whole heart, and let her draw it?</p>

<p class='c010'>So much for the drawings of my secretary; and now for my own
early drawings. When I was a school boy, we used to represent
human figures in this way; and, as you see, Craig got the essentials
(Figs. <a href='#fig_106'>106</a>, <a href='#fig_106a'>106a</a>):</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The border-line between successes and failures is not easy
to determine. Bear in mind that we are not conducting a drawing
class, nor making tests of my wife’s eyesight: we are trying to ascertain
whether there does pass from my mind to hers, or from my
drawing to her mind, a recognizable impulse of some sort. So, if
she gets the essential feature of the drawing, we are entitled to
call it evidence of telepathy. I think the fan with “crumpled cloth”
(Fig. <a href='#fig_102'>102</a>), and the umbrella handle that may be a “snake crawling
out of something,” but that “looks like a cat’s tail” (Fig. <a href='#fig_122'>122</a>), and
the screw that was called a “tower” (Fig. <a href='#fig_126'>126</a>)—all these are really
successes. I will append a number of examples, about which there
seems to me no room for dispute, and which I have called successes.

“upside-downness” has nothing to do with these tests, as Craig is

<p class='c010'>You note that my wife “got,” not merely the whole top of the
drawing, but some impression of the arms, which are crossed in
a peculiar way. I ask her about this case—the drawing having been
made less than a month ago—and I find that she remembers it well.
She saw what she thought was a turban wound about the head, and
got the impression of color. She wrote the words “not hair” to
make this clear. The rest of the comment written at the time was:
“See back of head, ear, and swirling scarf tied around head.”</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><em>20</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>I have now given nearly all the 65 drawings which I call “successes,”
and about half the 155 which I call “partial successes.”
This, I think, is enough for any purpose. No one can seriously
claim that such a set of coincidences could happen by chance, and
so it becomes necessary to investigate other possible explanations.</p>

<p class='c010'>First, a hoax. As covering that point, I prepared a set of affidavits
as to the good faith of myself, my wife, her sister, and her
sister’s husband. These affidavits were all duly signed and witnessed;
but friends, reading the manuscript, think they use up
space to no purpose, and that the reader will ask no more than the
statement that this book is a serious one, and that the manuscript
was carefully read by all four of the persons mentioned above, and
approved by them as representing the exact truth.</p>

<p class='c010'>That a group of persons should enter into a conspiracy to
perpetrate a hoax is conceivable. Whether or not it is conceivable
of the group here quoted is something of which the reader is the
judge. But this much is clear: any reader who, having read the
above, still suspects us, will not be convinced by further protestations.</p>

<p class='c010'>How about the possibility of fraud by one person? No one
who knows Mary Craig Sinclair would suspect her; but you who
do not know her have, naturally, the right to consider such an
hypothesis. Can she be one of those women who enjoy being
talked about? The broaching of this idea causes her to take the
pencil away from her husband, and you now hear her own authentic
voice, as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>“I happen to be a daughter of that once very living thing, ‘the
Old South,’ and there are certain ideals which are in my blood.
The avoidance of publicity is one of them. But even if I had ever
had a desire for publicity, it would have been killed by my actual
experiences as the wife of a social crusader. My home is besieged
by an endless train of persons of every description, who travel over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>the place, knocking on doors and windows, and insisting upon having
a hearing for their various programs for changing the nature
of the universe. I have been driven to putting up barriers and
fences around my garden, and threatening to flee to the Himalayas,
and become a Yogic mistress, or whatever a Yogic ‘master’ of my
sex is called.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Jack London tried to solve this problem by putting a sign
on the front door which read, ‘Go to the back door,’ and on the
back door one which read, ‘Go to the front door.’ But when I tried
this, one seeker of inspiration took his seat halfway between the
two doors, and declared that he would remain there the rest of
his life, or until his wishes were acceded to. Another hid himself
in the swimming-pool, and rose up from its depths to confront me
in the dusk, when, as it happened, I was alone on the place, and
went out into the garden for a breath of air. A third announced
that he had a million dollars to present to my husband in person,
and would not be persuaded to depart until my brother invited
him to go downtown to supper, and so got him into a car. Having
faithfully fed the hungry millionaire, my brother drove him to the
police-station, where, after a serious talking-to by the chief, he
consented to carry his million dollars away. A fourth introduced
himself by mail as having just been released from the psychopathic
ward in Los Angeles, and intending to call upon us, for reasons not
stated. A fifth announced himself by telephone, as intending to
come at once and shoot my husband on sight. Yet another, seven
feet tall and broad in proportion, announced that he had a revelation
direct from God, and had come to have the manuscript revised.
When politely asked as to its nature, he rose up, towering over my
none too husky spouse and declaring that no human eye had ever
beheld it, and no human eye would ever be permitted to behold it.
Such experiences, as a continuing part of a woman’s life, do not
lead her to seek publicity; they tend rather to develop a persecution
complex.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Speaking seriously, I consider that I have every evidence of
the effect of people’s thoughts on each other. And my distrust of
human nature, in its present stage of evolution, is so great, that
the idea of having many persons concentrate their attention on
me is an idea from which I shrink. I agree with Richet that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>fact of telepathy is one of the most terrifying in existence; and
nothing but a deep love of truth has induced me to let this very
personal story be told in print.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Next, what about the possibility of unconscious fraud? This
also is a question to be frankly met. All students of psychology
know that the subconscious mind has dubious morals. One has only
to watch his own dreams to discover this. A person in a trance is
similar to one talking or walking in sleep, or a drunken man, or
one under the influence of a drug. But in this case it must be
noted that my wife has never been in a trance. In these mind-reading
tests, no matter how intense the “concentration,” there
is always a part of her mind which knows what she is doing. If
you speak to her, she is immediately “all there.” When she has her
mental pictures, she sits up and makes her drawing, and compares
it with mine, and this is a completely conscious act.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, I point out that a great deal of the most impressive
evidence does not depend upon Craig alone. The five drawings
with her brother-in-law, Figures 1, 16, 17, 18, 19, constitute by
themselves evidence of telepathy sufficient to convince any mind
which is open to conviction. While it would have been possible
for Craig and Bob to hoax Dollie and me, it could certainly not
have been done without Bob’s connivance. If you suggest that my
wife and my brother-in-law may have been fooling me, I reply that
there is a still greater mass of evidence which could not have been
a hoax without my connivance. When I go into my study alone—a
little sun-parlor at the front of a beach-house, with nothing but a
couch, a chair and a table—I certainly know that I am alone; and
when I make a drawing and hold it before my eyes for five or ten
minutes, I certainly know whether any other person is seeing it.
This covers the drawings presented as Figures 2, 20, and 21, with
four others told about in the same series. It seems to me these
seven cases by themselves are evidence of telepathy sufficient to
convince any open mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Furthermore, there are the several score drawings which I
made in my study and sealed up in envelopes, taking them to my
wife and watching her lay them one by one upon her body and
write down more or less accurately what was in them. I certainly
know whether I was alone when I made the drawings, and whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>I made the contents of the envelopes invisible, and whether my
wife had any opportunity to open the envelopes before she made
her drawings. Of course, I understand the familiar conjuring trick
whereby you open one envelope, and hide it in your palm, and
pretend to be describing the next one while really describing the
one you have seen. But I would stake my life upon the certainty
that my wife knows no sleight-of-hand, and anyhow, I made certain
that she did not open the first one; I sat and watched her, and after
each test she handed me the envelopes and drawings, one by one—the
envelopes having previously been numbered by me. She would
turn out the reading-light which was immediately over her head,
but there was plenty of light from other parts of the room, enough
so that I could look at drawings as they were shown to me. Often
these tests were done in the daytime, and then all we did was to
pull down the window-shades back of the couch.</p>

<p class='c010'>It should be obvious that I stand to lose much more than I
stand to gain by publishing a book of this sort. Many have urged
me not to take the risk. It is the part of prudence not to believe
too many new and strange ideas. Some of my Socialist and materialist
friends are going to say—without troubling to read what I have
written: “Sinclair has gone in for occultism; he is turning into a
mystic in his old age.” It is true that I am fifty-one, but I think my
mind is not entirely gone; and if what I publish here is mysticism,
then I do not know how there can be such a thing as science about
the human mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have made repeated tests to see what happens; we have
written down our observations as we go along; we have presented
the evidence carefully and conscientiously, without theories; and
what any scientist can do, or ask to have done, more than this, I
cannot imagine. Those who throw out these results will not be
scientists, but merely another set of dogmatists—of whom new crops
are continually springing up, wearing new disguises and new labels.
The plain truth is that in science, as in politics and religion, it is
a lot easier to believe what you have been taught, than to set out
for yourself and ascertain what happens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of course the thing would be more convincing if it were done
in the presence of strangers. That brings up a question which is
bound to be asked, so I will save time by answering it here. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>first essential to success in these tests is a state of mind; and at
present my wife is a sensitive woman, at the stage of life described
as “glandular imbalance.” She has never tried these experiments
in the presence of a stranger, and has no idea whether she could get
the necessary concentration. She learned from her experiments
with her sick brother-in-law that the agent can send you pain and
fear, as well as chairs and table-forks, and she would certainly not
enter lightly into a condition of <em>rapport</em> with those whom she did
not know and trust.</p>

<p class='c010'>She insists that the way for you to be really certain is to follow
her example. If you sat and watched her do it, you might go away
with doubts, as she did after her experiments with Jan. But when
you have done it yourself, then you <em>know</em>. One reason the thing
has not been proven to the public is that people depend on professional
mediums, many of whom are deliberate and conscious cheats.
Others are vain and temperamental, difficult to manage; and research
is hindered by their instability. That is why Craig set to
work and learned to do it, and she believes that others can do the
same, if they have the desire and the patience.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><em>21</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The next thing is to carry out our promise and tell you the
technique. My wife has, among her notes, a mass of writing on this
subject in the form of instructions to Bob, and others who were
interested. I tried to condense it, but found I could not satisfy her,
and in the end I realized that her point of view is correct. No one
objects to repetition of phrases in a legal document, where the one
essential is precision; and the same thing applies to descriptions of
these complicated mental processes. This was the most difficult
writing task she ever undertook, and the reason lies in its newness,
and the complexity of the mind itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you want to learn the art of conscious mind-reading, this will
tell you how; and if you don’t want to learn it, you can easily skip
this section of the book. Here is Craig’s statement:</p>

<p class='c010'>“The first thing you have to do is to learn the trick of undivided
attention, or concentration. By these terms I mean something
quite different from what is ordinarily meant. One ‘concentrates’
on writing a chapter in a book, or on solving a problem in
mathematics; but this is a complicated process of dividing one’s
attention, giving it to one detail after another, judging, balancing,
making decisions. The kind of concentration I mean is putting the
attention on <em>one</em> object, or one <em>uncomplicated</em> thought, such as joy,
or peace, and holding it there steadily. It isn’t thinking; it is inhibiting
thought, except for one thought, or one object in thought.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have to inhibit the impulse to think things about the
object, to examine it, or appraise it, or to allow memory-trains to
attach themselves to it. The average person has never heard of such
a form of concentration, and so has to learn how to do it. Simultaneously,
he must learn to relax, for strangely enough, a part of concentration
is complete relaxation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There seems to be a contradiction here, in the idea of simultaneous
concentration and relaxation. I do not know whether this
is due to a contradiction in the nature of the mind itself, or to our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>misunderstanding of its nature. Perhaps we each have several
mental entities, or minds, and one of these can sleep (be blankly
unconscious), while another supervises the situation, maintaining
the first one’s state of unconsciousness for a desired period, and
then presenting to it some thought or picture agreed on in advance,
thus restoring it to consciousness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anyway, it is possible to be unconscious and conscious at the
same time! Almost everyone has had the experience of knowing,
while asleep, that he is having a bad dream and must awaken himself
from it. Certainly some conscious entity is watching the dream,
and knowing it is a dream; and yet the sleeper is ‘unconscious.’ Or
perhaps there is no such thing as complete relaxation—until death.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All I can say is this: when I practice this art which I have
learned, with my mind concentrated on one simple thing, it is a
relaxation as restful, as seemingly ‘complete’ as when I am in that
state called normal sleep. The attention is not allowed to be on the
sensations of the body, or on anything but the one thing it is deliberately
‘concentrated’ on.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Undivided concentration, then, means, for purposes of this
experiment, a state of complete relaxation, under specified control.
To concentrate in this undivided way you first give yourself a ‘suggestion’
to the effect that you will relax your mind and your body,
making the body insensitive and the mind a blank, and yet reserving
the power to ‘break’ the concentration in a short time. By
making the body insensitive I mean simply to relax completely
your mental hold of, or awareness of, all bodily sensation. After
giving yourself this suggestion a few times, you proceed to relax
both body and mind. Relax all mental interest in everything in
the environment; inhibit all thoughts which try to wander into
consciousness from the subconsciousness, or from wherever else
thoughts come. This is clearly a more thorough affair than ‘just
relaxing.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Also, there is something else to it—the power of supervising
the condition. You succeed presently in establishing a blank state
of consciousness, yet you have the power to become instantly conscious,
also; to realize when you are about to go into a state of sleep,
in which you have not the power of instantly returning to consciousness.
Also, you control, to a certain degree, what is to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>presented to consciousness when you are ready to become conscious.
For example, you want a message from the person who is sending
you a message; you do not want a train of subconscious ‘day dreams.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“All this is work; and so far, it is a bore. But when you have
learned to do it, it is an art worth knowing. You can use it, not only
for such experiments as telepathy and clairvoyance, but for improving
your bodily health. To relax thoroughly several times each
day while holding on to a suggestion previously ‘planted’ in the
subconsciousness is more beneficial to health than any other one
measure I know.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The way to relax is to ‘let go.’ ‘Let go’ of every tense muscle,
every tense spot, in the body. Pain is tension. Pain can be inhibited
by suggestion <em>followed by complete relaxation</em>. Drop your body,
a dead-weight, from your conscious mind. Make your conscious
mind a blank. It is the mind, conscious or subconscious, which
holds the body tense. Give to the subconsciousness the suggestion
of concentrating on one idea, and then completely relax consciousness.
To make the conscious mind a blank it is necessary to ‘let go’
of the body; just as to ‘let go’ of the body requires ‘letting go’ of
consciousness of the body. If, after you have practiced ‘letting go’
of the body, you find that your mind is not a blank, then you have
not succeeded in getting your body rid of all tension. Work at it
until you can let both mind and body relax completely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It may help you to start as follows: Relax the body as completely
as possible. Then visualize a rose, or a violet—some pleasant,
familiar thing which does not arouse emotional memory-trains.
Gaze steadily, peacefully, at the chosen object—think only of it—try
not to let any memories it may arouse enter your mind. Keep
attention steady, just seeing the color, or the shape of the flower
and nothing else. Do not think things about the flower. Just look
at it. Select one thing about it to concentrate on, such as its shape,
or its color, or the two combined in a visual image: ‘pink and
round.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you find that you are made nervous by this effort, it is apt
to be due to the fact that you are thinking things. Maybe the object
you have chosen has some buried memories associated with it—something
which arouses unconscious memories of past unhappy
events. Roses may suggest a lost sweetheart, or a vanished garden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>where you once were happy and to which you long to return. If so,
select some other flower to concentrate on. Flowers are usually the
most restful, the things which are not so apt to be involved with
distressing experiences. A bottle of ink might suggest the strain of
mental work, a spoon might suggest medicine. So, find a peace-inspiring
object to look at. When you have found it, just look at it,
with undivided attention.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you succeed in doing this, you will find it hard not to
drop asleep. But you must distinguish between this and the state
you are to maintain. If you drop asleep, the sleep will be what is
called auto-hypnotic sleep, and after you have learned to induce it,
you will be able to concentrate on an idea, instead of the rose, and
to carry this idea into the sleep with you as the idea to dominate
the subconsciousness while you sleep. This idea, taken with you
into sleep in this way, will often act in the subconsciousness with
the same power as the idea suggested by a hypnotist. If you have
ever seen hypnotism, you will know what this means. You can
learn to carry an idea of the restoration of health into this auto-hypnotic
sleep, to act powerfully during sleep. Of course this curative
effect is not always achieved. Any idea introduced into the
subconsciousness may meet a counter-suggestion which, if you are
ill, already exists in the subconsciousness, and a conflict may ensue.
Thus, time and perseverance may be necessary to success.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But this is another matter, and not the state for telepathy—in
which you must avoid dropping into a sleep. After you have
practiced the exercise of concentrating on a flower—and avoiding
sleep—you will be able to concentrate on holding the peculiar blank
state of mind which must be achieved if you are to make successful
experiments in telepathy. There may be strain to start with, but it
is getting rid of strain, both physical and mental, which constitutes
relaxation, or blankness, of the conscious mind. Practice will teach
you what this state is, and after a while you can achieve it without
strain.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The next step: ask someone to draw a half-dozen simple
designs for you on cards, or on slips of paper, and to fold them so
that you cannot see the contents. They should be folded separately,
so that you can handle one at a time. Place them on a table, or
chair, beside your couch, or bed, in easy reach of your hand, so that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>you can pick them up, one at a time, while you are stretched out
on the bed, or couch, beside them. It is best at first to experiment
in the dark, or at least in a dimly lit room, as light stimulates the
eyes and interferes with relaxation. If you experiment at night,
have a table lamp within easy reach, so that you can turn the light
off and on for each experiment without too much exertion, as you
must keep your body and mind as passive as possible for these
experiments. If you have no reading light near, use a candle. You
must have also a writing pad and pencil beside you.</p>

<p class='c010'>“After you have placed the drawings on the table, turn off the
light and stretch your body full length on the couch. Close your
eyes and relax your body. Relax completely. Make the mind a
complete blank and hold it blank. Do not think of anything.
Thoughts will come. Inhibit them. Refuse to think. Do this for
several moments. It is essential to induce a passive state of mind
and body. If the mind is not passive, it feels body sensations. If the
body is not relaxed, its sensations interfere with the necessary mental
passivity. Each reacts on the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The next step, after having turned off the light and closed
your eyes and relaxed mind and body full length on the couch, is to
reach for the top drawing of the pile on the table. Hold it in your
hand over your solar plexus. Hold it easily, without clutching it.
Now, completely relaxed, hold your mind a blank again. Hold it
so for a few moments, then give the mental order to the unconscious
mind to tell you what is on the paper you hold in your hand. Keep
the eyes closed and the body relaxed, and give the order silently,
and with as little mental exertion as possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>“However, it is necessary to give it clearly and positively, that
is, with concentration on it. Say to the unconscious mind, ‘I want
the picture which is on this card, or paper, presented to my consciousness.’
Say this with your mind concentrated on what you are
saying. Repeat, as if talking directly to another self: ‘I want to see
what is on <em>this</em> card.’ Then relax into blankness again and hold
blankness a few moments, then try gently, without straining, to see
whatever forms may appear on the void into which you look with
closed eyes. Do not try to conjure up something to see; just wait
expectantly and let something come.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My experience is that fragments of forms appear first. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>example, a curved line, or a straight one, or two lines of a triangle.
But sometimes the complete object appears; swiftly, lightly, dimly-drawn,
as on a moving picture film. These mental visions appear
and disappear with lightning rapidity, never standing still unless
quickly fixed by a deliberate effort of consciousness. They are
never in heavy lines, but as if sketched delicately, in a slightly
deeper shade of gray than that of the mental canvas. A person not
used to such experiments may at first fail to observe them on the
gray background of the mind, on which they appear and disappear
so swiftly. Sometimes they are so vague that one gets only a notion
of how they look before they vanish. Then one must ‘recall’ this
first vision. Recall it by conscious effort, which is not the same
thing as the method of passive waiting by which the vision was first
induced. Instead, it is as if one had seen with open eyes a fragment
of a real picture, and now closes his eyes and looks at the <em>memory</em>
of it and tries to ‘see’ it clearly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is necessary to recall this vision and make note of it, so as
not to forget it. One is <em>sure</em> to forget it—indeed it is his duty to do
so—in the process of the next step, which is one of blankness again.
This blankness is, of course, a deliberate putting out of the conscious
mind of all pictures, including the one just visioned. One
must now order the subconscious not to present it to the conscious
mind’s picture-film again unless it is the right picture, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, the one
drawn on the card which is held in hand. Make the conscious mind
blank again for a brief space. Then look again on the gray canvas
of mind for a vision. This is to test whether the first vision came
from subconscious guessing, or whether it came from the deeper
mind—from some other source than that of the subconscious, which
is so apt to offer a ‘guess,’ or false picture.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do this whole performance two or three times, and if the first
vision persists in coming back, accept it. As soon as you have
accepted it—that is, decided that this is the correct vision—turn on
the light, and without looking at the card, or paper, which contains
the real picture, pick up the writing pad and pencil and make a
sketch of every detail of the vision-picture. This is a nuisance, as it
interrupts concentration and the desired passivity. But it is absolutely
necessary to record the vision in every detail, before one looks
at the real picture, the one on the card he has been holding in hand.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>If one does not make a record of his vision in advance of looking
at the card picture, he is certain to forget at least some part of it—maybe
something which is essential. Worse yet, he is apt to fool
himself; the mind is given to self-deception. As soon as it sees the
real drawing, it not only forgets the vision, but it is apt to imagine
that it visioned the picture it now sees on the card, which may or
may not be true. Imagination is a far more active function than
the average person realizes. This conscious-subconscious mind is
‘a liar,’ a weaver of fiction. It is the dream-mind, and also it is the
mind of memory trains.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not omit fragments which seem to be out of place in a
picture. These fragments may be the real things. If in doubt as to
what the object of your vision is, do not try to guess. But if you
have a ‘hunch’ that something you have seen is connected somehow
with a watch, for example, or with an automobile, make a note of
this ‘hunch.’ I use this popular word to indicate a real presentation
from some true source, something deeper and more dependable
than our own subconscious minds. I call this the ‘deep mind’ in
order to have a name for it. I do not know what it is, of course—I
am only judging from the behavior of the phenomena.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not fail to record what seems to be a very stray fragment,
for it may be a perfect vision of some portion of the real picture.
Record everything, and then later you can compare it carefully with
the real drawing. Of course, do not be fantastic in your conclusions.
Do not think you have gotten a correct vision of an automobile
because you saw a circle which resembled a wheel. However, I once
saw a circle and <em>felt</em> that it was an automobile wheel—felt it so
vividly that I became overwhelmed with curiosity to see if my ‘feeling’
was correct, and forthwith turned on the light and examined
the real picture in my hand. I found that it was indeed the wheel
of an automobile. But I do not do this kind of thing unless I have
a very decided ‘hunch,’ as it tends to lead back to the natural impulse
of the mind to ‘guess’—and guessing is one of the things one
has to strive to avoid. To a certain extent, one comes to know a
difference between a guess and a ‘hunch.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The details of this technique are not to be taken as trifles.
The whole issue of success or failure depends on them. At least,
this is so in my case. Perhaps a spontaneous sensitive, or one who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>has a better method, has no such difficulties. I am just an average
conscious-minded person, who set out deliberately to find a way to
test this tremendously important question of telepathy and clairvoyance,
without having to depend on a ‘medium,’ who might be
fooling himself, or me. It was by this method of careful attention
to a technique of details that I have found it possible to get telepathic
messages and to see pictures on hidden cards, and symbolic
pictures of the contents of books.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This technique takes time, and patience, and training in the
art of concentration. But this patience is in itself an excellent thing
to learn, especially for nervous and sick people. The uses of mental
concentration are too various and tremendously beneficial to enumerate
here. The average person has almost no power of concentration,
as he will quickly discover by trying to hold his undivided
attention on one simple object, such as a rose, or a bottle of ink, for
just a few minutes. He will find that a thousand thoughts, usually
association trains connected with the rose, or the ink, will appear
on his mental canvas, interrupting his concentration. He will find
that his mind behaves exactly like a moving-picture film, or a fireworks
display. It is the division of attention that uses up energy,
if I am not mistaken.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course this technique is not ‘original.’ I got it by selecting
from hints here and there in my reading, and from my general study
and observation of the behavior of the mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Among the difficulties to be overcome—and this is one which
is easily detected—is the appearing of visions of objects one has
observed in the environment just before closing the eyes. When I
close my eyes to make the next test, I invariably find that the last
picture, and my own drawing of it, and also the electric light bulb
which I have lighted in order to see the last picture—all these immediately
appear on the horizon of my mind. It often takes quite a
while to banish these memory-ghosts. And sometimes it is a mistake
to banish them, as the picture you hold in your hand may be quite
similar to the preceding one. If, therefore, a picture resembling
the preceding continues obstinately to represent itself, I usually
accept it, and often find that the preceding and present cards contain
similar pictures.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Another difficulty is the way things sometimes appear in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>fragments, or sections, of the whole picture. A straight line may
appear, and it may be either only a portion of the whole, or it may
be all there is on the card. Then I have to resist the efforts of my
imagination to speculate as to what object this fragment may be
part of. For instance, I see a series of points, and have the impulse
to ‘guess’ a star. I must say no to this guesswork, unless the indescribable
‘hunch’ feeling assures me it is a star. I must tell myself
it may be indeed a part of a star, but, on the other hand, it may be
a complete picture of the drawing in hand, perhaps the letter W,
or M, or it may be a part of a pennant, or what not. Then I must
start over, and hold blank a while. Then repeat the request to the
deep mind for the true picture. Now I may get a more complete
picture, or maybe this fragment reappears alone, or maybe it repeats
itself upside-down, or doubled up in most any way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I start all over once more and now I may get a series of fragments
which follow each other and jump together as do the comic
cartoons which are drawn on the screen with pen and ink. For
instance, two points appear, then another appears separately and
jumps to the first two, and joins up with them, then two more. The
result is a star, and this may be the true picture. It usually is. But
sometimes this is the subconscious mind, or perhaps the conscious,
trying to finish the object as it has ‘guessed’ it should be. This error
of allowing the conscious or the subconscious mind to finish the
object is one to be most careful about. As one experiments, he
realizes more and more that these two minds, the conscious and the
subconscious, are really one, subconsciousness being only a disorderly
store-house of memories. The third, or ‘deep mind’ is apparently
the one which gives us our psychic phenomena. Again I say,
I do not know what this ‘deep mind’ is; I use the words merely to
have a name for that ‘other thing’ which brings the message.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The conscious mind, combined with the subconscious, not
only wants to finish the picture, but decides sometimes to eliminate
a detail which does not belong to what it has guessed should be
there. For example, I will discuss the drawings which have been
given as Figures 35, 35a, in this book. I ‘visioned’ what looked like
a figure 5, except that at the top where there should be a small
vertical line projecting toward the right, there was a flare of very
long lines converging at one end. I consciously decided that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>long lines were an exaggeration and multiplication of what should
properly be at the top of a five, and that I should not accept them.
Here was conscious mind making a false decision. But by obeying
the rules I had laid down in advance, I was saved from this error of
consciousness. I closed my eyes, gave a call for the true picture, and
the lines appeared again, so I included them in my drawing. When
I opened the envelope and looked at the picture inside, it was an
oil derrick. So the flare of long lines was the real thing, while the
figure 5 was the interloper—at least, so I now consciously decided.
I thought that the figure 5 and the flare of lines were entirely separate
mental images, one following the other so rapidly that they
appeared to belong together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But again my conscious decision was in error. Several hours
later, after I had put the whole matter out of my mind and had
been attending to household duties, I suddenly remembered the
paper jacket of a German edition of my husband’s novel, ‘Oil,’
which was on a shelf in the next room to the one in which I had
made my experiments. Why did I suddenly remember this book?
I had not noticed it for a long time—its jacket drawings were out of
sight, as the book was wedged between many others on the book
shelves in an inconspicuous place in the room. On one side of the
jacket of this book was a picture of three oil derricks; on the other
side was a large dollar mark, almost covering one entire side of the
book. I had seen this jacket, had indeed taken special notice of it,
at the time of its arrival from Germany. So here seems to have been
a clear case of the subconscious mind at work during my experiment,
adding to my true vision of an oil derrick, the subconsciously
remembered dollar mark which looked like a figure 5, partly hidden
by the oil derrick in my vision. Here was a grand mix-up of the
false guesses of consciousness and subconsciousness, and the true
presentations from the ‘deep mind.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“But this was not the end. This confusion in regard to the
dollar mark went forward, in memory-trains to two other experiments.
Several days later, I was trying a new set of drawings, and
one of them caused in my mind a vision of the capital letter S. Instantly,
two parallel straight lines crossed it, turning it into a dollar
mark: $. Then it became an S again without the lines. Then the
lines came back. This strange behavior of my vision continued. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>was in a quandary as to which to accept, the S or the $. Then there
appeared an old-fashioned money-bag, such as I used to see in my
father’s bank as a child, full of small coins. It took its place in the
vision beside the dollar mark. I decided with the usual erroneous
consciousness that this money-bag was a hint from my real mind,
so I accepted the dollar mark as correct. But it turned out not to be.
When I looked at the drawing in hand it was a letter S. My subconsciousness
had supplied the money-bag, and the two parallel
lines.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Several days later, in a vision with a third set of drawings, I
saw a letter S, and then at once the bag of small change appeared,
but there were no parallel lines on the S. This time the real drawing
was a dollar mark! So, my subconsciousness, as soon as the dollar
mark had appeared in subconsciousness, had meddled again; it had
remembered the last experiment and the scolding I had given it for
its guess work, so it now subtracted the parallel lines from the new
vision to make it correct, according to the last experiment. It had
remembered the last experiment only, forgetting the first one, of
the oil derrick, just as I had ordered it to do on the occasion of the
second experiment. So, it subtracted the two parallel lines, but it
added the remembered bag of money, which I had included in my
scolding. From this kind of interference by the subconsciousness,
I realized that it is indeed no simple matter to get things into consciousness
from the ‘deep mind’ without guesses and additions and
subtractions made by the subconsciousness. Why the subconscious
should meddle, I do not know. But it does. Its behavior is exactly
like that of the conscious mind, which is also prone to guessing.
All this sounds fantastic—to anyone who has not studied his mind.
But I tell you how it seems to me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maybe everything comes from the subconscious. Maybe there
is no ‘deep mind.’ Maybe the subconscious gets its knowledge of
what is on the drawing directly from the drawing, and is merely
blundering around, adding details by guesswork to what it has seen
incompletely. But I think that these experiments prove that this
is not the case. I think a study of them shows that a true vision
comes into the subconsciousness, not directly from the drawing, but
from another mind which has some means of knowing, and sending
to consciousness via the subconsciousness whatever I ask it for. Of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>course I cannot attempt to prove this here. It was one of the questions
to which I was seeking an answer, and the result seems to point
to the existence of a deeper mind, showing how its behavior is quite
different from that of the subconscious.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wanted to find out if the true vision could in any way be
distinguished from ‘imagination,’ or these busy guesses of the subconsciousness.
To help myself in this matter, I first made an examination
of exactly how these guesses come. I said to myself: every
thought that ever comes to consciousness, excepting those due to
direct outside stimulation, may proceed from some deeper source,
and by subconscious memory-trains attaching to them, appear to
be the work of subconsciousness. So I shut my eyes and made my
mind blank, without calling on my mind to present any definite
thing. I had no drawing in my hand. After a brief space of blankness,
I relaxed the enforced blankness and waited, dreamily, for
what might come. A picture soon came, with a whole memory-train.
First a girl in a large garden hat, then a garden path and
flowers bordering it, then a spade, a wheelbarrow, and so on—things
associated in my memory with a girl in a garden hat. As to where
the girl in the hat came from, I know not. As to why she should
come instead of any other of billions of things seen by me during
my life, I know not. I had not asked my mind for her. The question
of why she came is interesting.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it was easy to account for the other things—the association-train.
I learned from this experiment, and several repetitions of it,
that something always came—a girl, or a steamship, or the fact that
I had not attended to some household duty, or what not—and a train
of associated ideas followed. I learned, in a more or less vague way,
how these things behaved, and how I <em>felt</em> about them. This enabled
me to notice, when later I got a true vision, that there was a difference
between the way this true vision came and the way the ‘idle’
visions came. When the true visions came, there usually came with
them a ‘something’ which I call a ‘hunch.’ There was, of course,
always in my consciousness the question: is this the right thing, or
not? When the true vision came, this question seemed to receive
an answer, ‘yes,’ as if some intelligent entity was directly informing
me.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“This was not always the case. At times no answer came, or at
least, if it came, it was obscured by guesses. But usually it did, after
I had watched for it, and a sort of thrill of triumph came with it,
quite different from the quiet way in which the money-bag had
appeared in answer to my uncertainty. The subconscious answers
questions, and its answers are always false; its answers come quietly,
like a thief in the night. But the ‘other’ mind, the ‘deep mind’
answers questions, too, and these answers come, not quietly, but as
if by ‘inspiration,’ whatever that is—with a rustling of wings, with
gladness and conviction. These two minds seem different from each
other. One lies and rambles; the other sings, and is truthful.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But do not misunderstand me. I am not a religious convert.
I am searching for knowledge, and recording what I find. Others
on this search may have found these same things, but the conclusions
they have drawn may not turn out to be the ones I shall draw.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One or two other things of interest should perhaps be mentioned.
First, I found that, in doing a series of several drawings, the
percentage of successes was higher in the first three attempts. Then
there began to be failures, alternating with successes. This may
have been due to the fact that the memory-pictures of these first
three experiments now constituted a difficulty. So much attention
had to be given to inhibiting these memory-pictures, and in deciding
whether or not they were to be inhibited. Or it may be due to
some other cause, such as fatigue or boredom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The second detail is that during the earliest experiments, I
developed a headache. I think this was due to the fact that I strained
my closed eyes trying to see with them. I mean, of course, trying to
see a vision, not the card in my hand. Using the eyes to see with is
a habit, and habits are not easily overcome. I soon learned not to
use my eyes, at least not in a strained way, and this was the end of
the headaches. However, this use of the eyes in telepathy may perhaps
mean more than a mere habit. The mental canvas on which
these ‘visions’ are projected seems to be spread in the eyes, and it is
the eyes which seem to see them—despite the fact that the room may
be dark, the eyes closed, and the drawing on the paper be wrapped
in thick covering and not within normal range of the eyes. But this
may be due to the habit of associating all pictures with your eyes.”</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><em>22</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>So much for the art of voluntary mind-reading. In conclusion
I, the husband, attempt to say a few words about what these phenomena
mean, and how they come about.</p>

<p class='c010'>This attempt involves me in a verbal duel with my wife, which
lasts into the small hours of morning. It involves the everlasting
debate between the vitalists and the mechanists, which had best be
left to Dr. Watson and Professor McDougall, and the others who
are no more able than I am to look at the neurons of the brain in
action, to see what happens. But I insist that until Craig and Dr.
Watson, Professor Eddington and Mrs. Eddy have found out positively
whether the universe is all mind or all matter, I must go on
speaking in the old-fashioned way, as if there were two worlds, the
physical and the mental, two sets of phenomena which interact one
upon the other continuously, even though the manner of this happening
is beyond comprehension.</p>

<p class='c010'>With this much apology, I obtain permission to put forth my
humble guess as to the part played by mental concentration in the
causing of telepathy, clairvoyance, and trance phenomena. It seems
to me that the process of intense concentration may cause the nervous
energy, or brain energy, whatever it is, to be withdrawn from
some of the brain centers and transferred to others; and it may be
this displacement and disturbance of balance which accounts for
such phenomena as catalepsy, automatism, and somnambulism.
Portions of the mind which are ordinarily below the level of consciousness
are raised to more intense forms of activity. New levels
of mind are tapped, new “personalities” or faculties are brought
into action, and persons under hypnotism develop mental powers
they do not consciously possess.</p>

<p class='c010'>That it is intense concentration upon one suggestion—the narrowing
of the attention to one focus—which produces the cataleptic
trance is something which my wife set out to prove, and by going
close to the border-line she feels that she did prove it. The rigidity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>began at the extremities and crept rapidly over the body. In spite
of my protests, Craig insisted that she was going the whole way,
and asked me to stand by and make some tests. I was to wait three
minutes, and then lift her up by the feet. I did so, and found an
extraordinary thing—the body was perfectly rigid, like a log of
wood, except at the neck! When I lifted her by her feet, the neck
bent, so that the head remained on the pillow, while the feet were
raised at least a yard in the air. Later, when Craig had relaxed, she
told me that she had known what was happening; there had been
one point of consciousness left, and she had the belief that she could
let that go in another moment, but was afraid to do so, because she
might not come out again. For an instant, she had felt that strange
terror one feels at the moment he ceases to struggle against the
fumes of gas or ether, and plunges into oblivion. The difference
is that, in the case of gas or ether, one cannot hold on to consciousness;
but in the case of the cataleptic state, he can recall his receding
consciousness. Craig, of course, had not concentrated with complete
attention to one idea; one portion of her mind was concentrated
upon achieving rigidity, while another was watching and
protesting against oblivion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Morton Prince wrote to Craig: “You are playing with
powerful and dangerous forces.” And so she dropped this form of
experiment. But more should be known about these trances, which
often occur spontaneously, and can be caused by fear—that is to say,
an intense concentration on the idea of escape from danger, which
produces a tension amounting to paralysis. In such cases there are
a number of new dangers; one being that some doctor will try to
restore you with drugs and wrong suggestions. Every suggestion of
fear on the part of the onlookers must be avoided in case of trances,
for the subconscious mind of the victim hears every word, and
believes it; also telepathy has to be remembered. One must not
only speak quietly and firmly, repeating that everything is all right,
and that the person will come out safely; one must also <em>think</em> this.
The trance may last a long time, but keep calm and sure of success,
and keep the doctor and the undertaker away. The condition of
catalepsy is more common than is realized, and it is unpleasant to
think how many persons are embalmed while in this condition.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>All this sounds disturbing, but it has nothing to do with our
telepathy experiments, in which the state of concentration is not
one of tension accompanied by the suggestion of rigidity, or of fear,
but on the contrary is a state of relaxation, accompanied by the
suggestion of control, or supervision. This matter of supervision
has been carefully set forth by Craig in her statement. It is one of
the mind’s great mysteries: how, while thinking about nothing,
you can not only remember to give a suggestion, but can also act
upon it. Craig insists that we have three minds; and she has in this
the backing of William McDougall, an Englishman, who was called
the “dean” of American psychologists. McDougall talks about the
various “monads” of the mind; so let us say that one “monad”
gives an order to a second “monad” to become blank, after it has
given an order to a third to present to the first a picture.</p>

<p class='c010'>The psychic Jan gives such “autosuggestions” to himself when
he goes into a trance, and tells his trance mind to bring him out at
a certain moment. How that trance mind can measure time as
exactly as a clock is another of the mysteries; but that it happens is
beyond doubt. My wife took Jan to a group of scientists in Boston,
and several of them held watches and expressed their surprise at
what Jan was able to do. It is obvious that when the psychic lets
himself be buried six feet under the ground in an ordinary pine-wood
coffin, he is staking his life upon his certainty that he will not
come out of the state of lethargy until after he has been dug up.</p>

<p class='c010'>He also stakes it upon the hope that the physicians who have
the test in charge will have sufficient sense to realize the importance
of having him dug out at the time agreed. In one case they were
several minutes late, and Jan nearly suffocated. I never saw one of
these burials, because Craig obtained his promise not to do them
after she knew him; but I have talked with several physicians who
watched and directed all the details, and I have a moving-picture
film of one.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Mention telepathy in company, and almost everyone has a
story to tell. You can find a clairvoyant to tell you about yourself
for a dollar—and maybe she is a fraud, but then again, maybe she is
a person with a gift which she does not understand, and the police
throw her into jail because they don’t understand it either. I am
sorry if I aid the mass of fraud which I know exists in this field, but
there is no power of man which may not and will not be abused.
The person who invented high explosives and made possible great
tunnels and bridges, also made possible the destruction of the Louvain
library. The person who makes a dynamo may electrocute
himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>In spite of all fraud, I am convinced that there are thousands
of genuine clairvoyants and psychics. My friend Will Irwin told
me recently how he spent a year or so collecting material and writing
an exposure of fraud, “The Medium Game,” published in <cite>Collier’s
Weekly</cite> some twenty years ago. At the end of his labors he
went, on sudden impulse, into a “parlor” on Sixth Avenue, a cheap
neighborhood of New York, and a fat old woman in a greasy wrapper
took his dollar, and held his hand in hers, and told him things
which he believed were known to no human being but Will Irwin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the use of it?” some will ask. I reply with another
question: “What was the use of the lightning which Franklin
brought down from the clouds on his kite-string?” No use that
Franklin ever knew; yet today we make his lightning turn the
wheels of industry, and move great railroad systems, and light a
hundred million homes, and spread jazz music and cigarette advertising
thousands of miles in every direction. It is an axiom of the
scientist that every scrap of knowledge will be put to use sooner or
later; get it, and let the uses wait. The discovery of the cause of
bubonic plague was made possible because some foolish-minded
entomologist had thought it worth-while to collect information
about the fleas which prey upon the bodies of rats and ground
squirrels.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>I know a certain Wall Street operator who employed a “psychic”
to sit in at his business conferences, and tell him if the other
fellow was honest. I believe it didn’t work very well; perhaps the
circumstances were not favorable to concentration. Needless to say,
Craig and I have no interest in such uses to be made of our knowledge.
What telepathy means to my wife is this: it seems to indicate
a common substratum of mind, underlying our individual minds,
and which we can learn to tap. Figure the conscious mind as a tree,
and the subconscious mind as the roots of that tree: then what of
the earth in which the tree grows, and from which it derives its sustenance?
What currents run through that earth, affecting all the
trees of the forest? If one tree falls, the earth is shaken—and may not
the other trees feel the impulse?</p>

<p class='c010'>In other words, we are apparently getting hints of a cosmic
consciousness, or cosmic unconsciousness: some kind of mind stuff
which is common to us all, and which we can bring into our individual
consciousness. Why is it not sensible to think that there may
be a universal mind-stuff, just as there is a universal body-stuff, of
which we are made, and to which we return?</p>

<p class='c010'>When Craig orders her mind, or some portion of it, or faculty
of it, to get what is in Bob’s mind, while Bob is forty miles away—and
when her mind does that, what are we to picture as happening?
If I am correct in my guess, that mind and body are two aspects of
one reality, then we shall find some physical form of energy being
manifested, just as we do when we communicate by sound waves.
The human brain is a storage battery, capable of sending impulses
over the nerves. Why may it not be capable of sending impulses by
means of some other medium, known or unknown? Why may there
not be such a thing as brain radio?</p>

<p class='c010'>Certainly we know this, that every particle of energy in the
universe affects to some slight extent every other particle. The
problem of detecting such energy is merely one of getting a sufficiently
sensitive device. Who can say that our thoughts are not
causing vibrations? Who can set a limit to the distance they may
travel, or to the receiving powers of another brain, in some way or
other attuned thereto? Any truly scientific person will admit that
this is a possibility, and that it is purely a question of experimenting,
to find out if it does happen, and how.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Again, consider the problem of clairvoyance, suggested by
Craig’s ability to tell what is inside a book she holds in her hand
without seeing it, or to reproduce drawings when no human mind
knows what drawing she holds. How are we to figure that as happening?
Shall we say that brain vibrations affect material things
such as paper, and leave impressions which endure for a long time,
possibly forever? Can these affect another brain, as in the case of
a bit of radium giving off emanations? It seems to me correct to say
that, theoretically, it is inevitable. Every particle of energy that
has ever been manifested in the universe goes on producing its
effects somewhere, somehow, and the universe is forever different
because of that happening. The soil of Britain is still shaking with
the tramp of Caesar’s legions, two thousand years old. Who can say
that some day we may not have instruments sensitive enough to
detect such traces of energy? On the very day that I am reading the
galley proofs of this book, I find in my morning paper an Associated
Press dispatch, from which I clip a few paragraphs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A fundamental discovery in photography that takes the ‘pictures’
directly on cold, hard untreated metal without the usual
photographer’s medium of a sensitized plate was made public tonight
at Cornell University. It reveals that seemingly impervious
metal records on its surface unseen impressions from streams of
electrons and that these marks can be brought into visibility by the
right kind of a ‘developer,’ exactly as photographic images are
brought out on sensitized paper....</p>

<p class='c010'>“While studying sensitivity of photographic plates to electron
rays it suddenly was realized that polished metal surfaces might be
able to pick up impressions of these beams, and when tests were
made they showed that not only could such records be made on
metals, but the amazing fact appeared that some metals are almost
as sensitive as photographic film, and for very low velocity electrons
much more sensitive....</p>

<p class='c010'>“This young physicist one day was looking at the rough spots
produced on the metal target of an x-ray tube by electron bombardment.
Such spots are commonplace, familiar sights to laboratory
workers. It occurred to Dr. Carr that perhaps long before the electrons
produced the rough place they made an invisible impression,
which might be ‘developed’ in the same manner that the still invisible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>image on a photo is brought out by putting it into a developing
bath. Carr shot the electron rays at gold plates and developed them
with mercury vapor, he shot them at silver and developed with
iodine, he used hydrochloric acid to develop zinc plates and iodine
to develop copper.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And now, if x-rays leave a permanent record on metal, why
might not brain-rays, or thought-rays, leave a record upon a piece
of paper? Why might not such energies be reflected back to another
brain, as light is reflected by a mirror? Or perhaps the record might
stay as some other form of energy, turned back into brain-rays or
thought-rays by the percipient. We are familiar with this in the
telephone, where sound vibrations are turned into electrical vibrations,
and in this form transported across a continent and under an
ocean, and then turned back into sound vibrations once again.</p>

<p class='c010'>That mental activities do leave some kind of record on matter
seems certain; at any rate, it is the basic concept of the materialistic
psychologist. For what is memory, to the materialist, but some kind
of record upon brain cells? He compares these cells to photoelectric
cells, and imagines a lot of stored up records which we can consult.
If now it should be found that such memory records are impressed,
not merely upon living brain cells, but upon the molecules or electrons
which compose any form of matter, what would be so incredible
about that?</p>

<p class='c010'>I have gone this far, in the effort to meet my materialist friends
halfway. For my part, I have no metaphysics; I am content to say
that I do not know what matter is, nor what mind is, nor how
they interact. If you want to realize the inadequacies of the materialistic
dogma, so far as concerns this special field, you may
consult the work of Dr. Rudolph Tischner, a qualified scientist of
Germany, whose book, <cite>Telepathy and Clairvoyance</cite>, is published
in translation by Harcourt, Brace and Company. The last chapter,
called “Theory,” deals with the suggested explanations in more
detail than I have the space for here.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>April 21, 1929. I am over at the office fixing up this manuscript
to send to the publisher; and just as I have it nicely wrapped,
it has to be opened again—for this is what has happened. Craig,
with her anxiety complex, has had this thought: “Here is Upton
committing himself in this public way, on a subject about which
people know so little and suspect so much; and suppose this faculty,
whatever it is, should be gone in these last few weeks, while I have
been fussing over spring housecleaning! Suppose I should find I
can never do it again!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She has to make sure all over again. She has in her desk a fat
envelope marked: “To try.” A lot of old drawings, left-overs from
different series that she has tried and failed on during the past
several months; some that she herself has drawn for friends; some
that she was interrupted while doing—a job lot, in short. She does
not know how many, as she has stuck them in from time to time,
and never looked into the envelope; but it is well filled. Now she
takes out some drawings, with averted eyes, and lies down and
tries them. The house is quiet, a good opportunity, so she does
nine drawings, and there is only one complete failure in the lot.</p>

<p class='c010'>One is a marvel—as good as any. It is a drawing I had made,
a donkey’s head and neck, with a wide collar. Craig writes: “Cow’s
head in ‘stock’”—a “stock” being in Mississippi a wooden yoke
made to keep cattle from jumping fences. She draws the head of
the so-called “cow” and the “stock”; it is a perfect donkey’s head,
facing just as mine does.</p>

<p class='c010'>And then there is a duck, about to eat a snail. Such a jolly
duck, and such a wheely snail shell! Craig has made this drawing
to amuse the little daughter of Bob and Dolly, who had a pet duck,
called “Mary Ann,” fed on snails. Craig made this drawing several
months ago, to let the child “concentrate” on, and try telepathy
like the grown-ups. And now, with this drawing under her hand,
Craig writes: “See wheels. Think of children. Has to do with
children.” The drawing of the snail shell is plainly a lot of “wheels.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Now, of course, Craig had previously seen every one of these
drawings, and so they were all in her subconscious mind. But these
drawings had never been seen by her at the same time. They were
put into the envelope, some at one time, some at another. Now
she has taken out a few at random. What a jumble for any subconscious
mind to keep track of! How is Craig’s mind to know
which drawings she has taken out, and which one she is holding
under her hand?</p>

<p class='c010'>Again we have something more than telepathy. For no human
mind knows what drawings she has taken from that envelope. No
human mind but her own even knows that she is trying an experiment.
Either there is some superhuman mind, or else there is
something that comes from the drawings, some way of “seeing,”
other than the way we know and use all the time. Make what you
can of this, but don’t laugh at it, for most certainly it happens.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'><em>25</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>October, 1929. At my wife’s insistence, I have held up this
book for six months, in order to think it over, and have the manuscript
read by friends whose opinions we value. A score or more
have read it, and made various suggestions, many of which I have
accepted. Some of the reactions of these friends may be of interest
to the reader.</p>

<p class='c010'>The news that I was taking up “psychic” matters brought me
letters both of curiosity and protest. My friend Isaac Goldberg of
Boston reported the matter in the Haldeman-Julius publications
under the title: “Sinclair Goes Spooky.” I hope that when he has
read this book, he will find another adjective. My friends, both
radical and respectable, must realize that I have dealt here with
facts, in as patient and thorough a manner as I have ever done in
my life. It is foolish to be convinced without evidence, but it is
equally foolish to refuse to be convinced by real evidence.</p>

<p class='c010'>There came to me a letter of warning from a good comrade,
T. H. Bell of Los Angeles, an elderly Scotchman who has grown
up in the Socialist movement, and known the old fighters of the
days when I was a child. He begged me not to jeopardize my
reputation; so I thought he would be a good test for the manuscript,
and asked him to read it. Some of his suggestions I accepted,
and the work is the better for them. But Comrade Bell was not
able to believe that Craig’s drawings could have come by telepathy,
for the reason that it would mean that he was “abandoning the
fundamental notions” on which his “whole life has been based.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Comrade Bell brought many arguments against my thesis, and
this was a service, because it enables me to answer my critics in
advance. First, what is the value of my memory? Can I be sure
that it does not “accommodate itself too easily to the statement
Sinclair wishes to believe?” My answer is that few of the important
cases in the book rest upon my memory; they rest upon records
written down at once. They rest upon drawings which were made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>according to a plan devised in advance, and then duly filed in envelopes
numbered and dated. Also, my memory has been checked by
my wife’s, who is a fanatic for accuracy, and has caused me torment,
through a good part of our married life, by insisting upon going
over my manuscripts and censoring every phrase. Also Bob and
Dollie and my secretary have read this narrative, and checked the
statements dealing with them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next objection, that I am “a man without scientific training.”
The acceptance of that statement depends upon the definition of
the word “scientific.” If it includes the social sciences, then I have
had twenty-five years of very rigid training. I have made investigations
and published statements, literally by thousands, which were
criminal libels unless they were true and exact; yet I have never
had any kind of libel suit brought against me in my life. As to the
scientific value of the particular experiments described in this
book, the reader can do his own judging, for they have been described
in detail. I don’t see how scientific training could have
increased our precautions. We have outlined our method to scientists,
and none has suggested any change.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next, the fact that in the past I have shown myself “naïve and
credulous at times.” No doubt I have; but I have learned by such
experiences, and I am not so naïve and credulous as when I was
younger. Neither do I see how these qualities can play much part
in the present matter. I surely know the conditions under which
I made my drawings, and whether I had them under my eyes while
my wife was making her drawings in another room; I know about
the ones I sealed in envelopes, and which were never out of my sight.
As for my wife, she certainly has nothing of the qualities of naïveté
and credulity. She was raised in a family of lawyers, and was given
the training and skeptical point of view of a woman of the world.
“Trust people, but watch them,” was old Judge Kimbrough’s
maxim; and following it too closely has almost made a pessimist
of his daughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next, that Craig is “in poor health.” That is true, but I do
not see how it matters here. She has often been in pain, but it has
never affected her judgment. She chose her own times for experimenting,
when she felt in the mood, and her mind was always clear
and keen for the job.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Next, “a husband and wife are a bad pair to make telepathic
experiments. Living so much together, their common life does tend
to make them think of the same thing at the same time.” This is
true; but how does it account for the half-dozen successes with a
brother-in-law, twenty or thirty with a secretary, and many with
Jan? How does it account for the covers and jackets of books in
which I had no interest, but which had come to me by chance, and
which Craig had never even glanced at, so far as she remembers?</p>

<p class='c010'>It is true that in the early days most of our drawings were of
obvious things which lay about the house, scissors, table-forks,
watches, chairs, telephones; so there was a better chance of guess
work. How much chance, was determined by my son and his wife,
who, hearing that Craig and I were trying telepathy experiments,
decided to try a few also—without knowing anything about the
technique. They also drew scissors, table-forks, watches, chairs,
telephones, and such common objects. The only trouble was that
when David tried to reproduce Betty’s drawings, he drew the chair
where she had drawn the scissors, and drew the watch where she
had drawn the table-fork, and so on. They did not get a single
success.</p>

<p class='c010'>I think that if you will go back and look over those drawings
as a whole, you must admit that the objects were as varied as the
imagination could make them. I do not see how any one could
choose a set of objects less likely to be guessed than the series which
I have numbered from 5 to 12—a bird’s nest full of eggs and surrounded
by leaves, a spiked helmet, a desert palm-tree, a star with
eight double points, a coconut palm, a puppy chasing a string, a
flying bat, a Chinese mandarin, and a boy’s foot with a roller-skate
on it. None of these objects has any relationship whatever to my
life, or to Craig’s, or to our common life. To say that a wife can
guess such a series, because she knows her husband’s mind so well,
seems to me out of all reason.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next, the point that some of the cases are not convincing by
themselves. I am familiar with this method of argument, having
encountered it with others of my books. Let me beg you to note
that the cases are <em>not</em> taken by themselves, but are taken as a whole.
I can think, for example, of several ways by which Craig might have
known that I had put my little paper of written notes into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>pocket of my gray coat, or that I had left some medical apparatus
under the bathtub at the office. She might have seen these things,
and then have forgotten it, and her subconscious mind might have
brought back to her the location of the objects, but failed to remind
her of the previous seeing. If such cases had stood alone, I would
not have thought it worth while to write this book.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same thing applies to Craig’s production of German
words. Having spent several weeks with me in Germany, and having
known many Germans, she no doubt has German words in her
subconscious mind. This also applies to certain dream cases. Any
one who wants to can go through the book and pick out a score of
cases which can be questioned on various grounds. Perhaps it
would be wiser for me to cut out all except the strongest cases. But
I rely upon your common sense, to realize that the strongest cases
have caused me to write the book; and that the weaker ones are
given for whatever additional light they may throw upon the problem.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you want to deal fairly with the book, here is what you have
to explain. How did it happen that at a certain agreed hour when
Bob at Pasadena drew a table-fork and dated and signed the drawing,
Craig in Long Beach wrote: “See a table-fork, nothing else,”
and dated and signed her words? If you call this a coincidence, how
are you going to account for the chair, and the watch, and the circle
with the hole in the middle, and the sense of pain and fear, and the
spreading black stain called blood, all reproduced under the same
perfect conditions? I say that if you call all this coincidence, you
are violating the laws of probability as we know them. I say that
there are only two possible explanations,—either telepathy, or that
my wife and her brother-in-law were hoaxing me.</p>

<p class='c010'>But if you want to assume a hoax, you have to face the fact
that my wife a few days later was reproducing a series of drawings
which I made and kept in front of my eyes in a separate room from
her, in such a position that she could not see them if she wanted to.
If I thought it worth while, I could draw you a diagram of the place
where she sat and the place where I sat, and convince you that
neither mirrors, nor a hole in the wall, nor any other device would
have enabled my wife to see my drawings, until I took them to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>and compared them with her drawings. The only way you can
account for that series of successes is to say that I am in on the hoax.</p>

<p class='c010'>My good friend and comrade, Tom Bell, does not suggest that
I am in it; but others may say it, so I will answer. Let me assure
you, there is no reason in the world why I should take the field
on behalf of the doctrine of telepathy—except my conviction that
it has been proved. I don’t belong to any church which teaches
telepathy. I don’t hold any doctrine which is helped by it. I don’t
make any money by advocating or practicing it. There is no more
reason why I should be concerned to vindicate telepathy, than there
is for my coming out in support of the Catholic doctrine of the
Immaculate Conception, or the Mormon doctrine of Urim and
Thummim, or the Koreshan doctrine that the earth is a hollow
sphere and we live on the inside of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>I assure you I am as cold-blooded about the thing as a man
can be. In fact, I don’t like to believe in telepathy, because I don’t
know what to make of it, and I don’t know to what view of the
universe it will lead me, and I would a whole lot rather give all my
time to my muckraking job which I know by heart. I don’t expect
to sell especially large quantities of this book; I am sure that by
giving the same amount of time and energy to other books I have
in mind, I could earn several times as much money. In short, there
isn’t a thing in the world that leads me to this act, except the conviction
which has been forced upon me that telepathy is real, and that
loyalty to the nature of the universe makes it necessary for me to
say so.</p>

<p class='c010'>My friend and publisher Charles Boni thinks that I should
write this book without protestations; taking a dignified position,
sure that my readers will trust me. But as it happens, I have read,
not merely the literature of psychic research, but also the literature
in opposition to it, and I know the arguments advanced by persons
who are unwilling to change their “fundamental notions.” It seems
common sense to answer here the objections which are certain to
be made.</p>

<p class='c010'>I submitted this manuscript to the two leading psychologists
of America, Morton Prince and William McDougall. Dr. Prince
was taken by death before he found time to read it, but Professor
McDougall read it, and has stated his reactions in the preface. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>writing to me, he expressed the hope that my wife would be able
to make some of these telepathy tests under the observation of well-known
scientists. In replying, I assured him that my wife and I
shared this hope; but whether it can ever be realized is a problem
for the future. All Craig’s work so far has depended upon a state
of complete peace and relaxation. As she has pointed out, it is a
matter of “undivided concentration,” and even such disturbing
things as light and noise are an interference. One friend who has
tried to experiment lately at our instigation gave it up because of
automobile horns in the street outside. She declared that these had
never disturbed her before, but that the effort not to hear them
when concentrating only caused her to concentrate on the horns,
and so threatened to give her a case of “nerves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Whether Craig would be able to get the necessary state of
mind in the presence of strangers, skeptical or possibly hostile, is
a problem yet to be solved. Unless we are going to beg the question,
we have to assume that telepathy may be a reality; and if it be a
reality, then certainly what is in the other person’s mind makes
a difference, and certainly it is a serious matter to ask a woman in
delicate health to open her mind to the moods of strangers. Some
day in the future Craig is going to make the test, but whether it
succeeds or fails will not alter, so far as I am concerned, what has
already happened in my presence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another of my friends who read the manuscript was Floyd
Dell, and he thinks that readers of my books will wish to know to
what extent, if any, my interest in the subject of telepathy is going
to change my attitude to the struggle for social justice. To that I
reply that I have been interested in psychic research for the past
thirty-five years, ever since, as a youth, I met Minot J. Savage; but
this has not kept me from believing ardently in the abolition of
parasitism, exploitation, and war. While the telepathy experiments
were going on I wrote “Boston,” a novel of some 325,000 words, in
less than a year. While I am consulting with my friends about
this manuscript, I am writing a novel, “Mountain City,” which I
hope my Socialist friends will find of interest. The only discovery
that can weaken my interest in the economic problem will be one
which enables human beings to live without food, clothing, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>shelter. But in the meantime, I see no reason why Socialists are
required to be ignorant of psychology.</p>

<p class='c010'>James Fuchs, another patient critic of my writings, thinks I
appear naïve in this book, and should reveal some knowledge of
the vast literature on the subject. My reason for not doing so is
that very vastness; one would need several volumes to handle it.
In the Proceedings of the American and British Societies for Psychical
Research lies buried endless evidence on the subject; but scientific
authority remains for the most part uninterested in that
evidence, and would not be interested in my rehash of it. I have
written this book to tell my readers and friends what I myself have
seen with my own eyes. That is my job, and I leave the rest to others
who are better qualified.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fuchs reminds me that “umbilical sensory perception” is a
well-known psychic phenomenon, and that Craig, in holding the
drawings over her solar plexus, is repeating the method of Justinus
Kerner (1786–1862), about whom you will find an article in the
“Encyclopedia Britannica.” Craig knew about that from various
sources, and some of her experiments were designed to test the
explanation. I made eight drawings and laid them face down on the
table by her couch, perhaps three feet from her head. I put them
there while she was out of the room, and I sat and watched, to be
sure she did not ever touch them. She lay on the couch and made
some notes and drawings which reproduced the essential features
of half a dozen of my drawings—all at once! So, if Craig has an
umbilical eye, she must also have one in the side of her head which
can see through several thicknesses of paper.</p>

<p class='c010'>My daughter-in-law at that time also made suggestions which
I accepted. She spoke for the new generation of radicals, saying:
“The book aroused a storm of metaphysical speculation in my
mind, and I could wax eloquent with slight provocation.” This
is different from refusing to “abandon the fundamental notions on
which my whole life has been based.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>
  <h3 class='c003'><em>26</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>One interesting point I observe: in any company where
the subject of this manuscript is brought up, invariably some person
declares that he or she has had such experiences. One lady,
highly educated, assured me that she and her husband had developed
telepathy to a point where it served them on a lonely ranch
in the place of telegraph and telephone. Only a few days ago I met
at luncheon Bruno Walter, orchestra leader, who had come from
Germany to conduct concerts in the Hollywood Bowl. Mr. Walter
narrated to me the incident which follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>While conducting in some middle western city, he was a guest
at a luncheon, and found himself becoming very ill. He explained
matters to his host, who called a taxicab, but this cab did not arrive,
and Mr. Walter, in great distress, took his hat and left the house,
saying that he would look for a cab. Turning the corner of the
street, he came upon his manager, driving a car, and hailed him.
“A most fortunate accident!” exclaimed the sick man, but the
manager assured him that it was no accident; about half an hour
previously, the manager had been seized by an intense feeling that
Mr. Walter was in trouble, and had been moved to get into his
car and drive. He did not know where Mr. Walter had gone, but
simply followed his impulse to drive in a certain direction.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another incident, told me by Fremont Older, editor of the San
Francisco <cite>Call</cite>, and a veteran fighter in the cause of social justice.
Older had seen many demonstrations of telepathy, and was completely
convinced of its reality. A friend of his, living on a ranch,
employed a cook named Sam who had the gift, and agreed to give
a demonstration for the Olders. Sam asked Older to get a book and
wrap it in thick paper, and Sam would tell the name of the book and
the author. Older went out to his car, but could find no book, only
a folder of maps, which he wrapped in several thicknesses of paper.
Sam put the package to his head, and after a minute or two said,
“This is not a book, it is a map or something. Why don’t you get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>me a regular book?” So Older went to his car again and found a
book belonging to his wife, and wrapped it with care and tied it.
Sam put it to his head, and began to spell letters, and finally stated
as follows: “Julia France and her Times, by Gertrude Atherton,
published by the Macmillan Company.” This was correct. Sam
added: “I get another name. What has Ernest Hopkins got to do
with this book?” Older and his wife were dumbfounded; for the
name was that of a member of the newspaper staff who had been
asked to review the book, but Mrs. Older had taken the copy from
him because at the last moment she wanted something to read on
her trip.</p>

<p class='c010'>As this book is going to the printer, my attention is called to
the fact that Dr. Carl Bruck of Berlin has published a book entitled
“Experimentelle Telepathie,” in which he reports a series of tests
closely resembling those here described. The main difference is
that he used hypnotized subjects, four different young men, as the
recipients of his telepathic messages. He made drawings at home,
and locked them in a large portfolio, which he placed in an adjoining
room from the subject, two or three yards distant through
a wall. He himself sat in front of the hypnotized subject, and concentrated
upon “sending” one of the drawings. Under these
conditions, in a total of 111 experiments, one-third were successful.
The Berlin correspondent of the “Scientific American” reported
these tests in the issue of May, 1924, where those interested may
read the details, and inspect twelve of the drawings. The tests were
conducted in the presence of various physicians and scientists; and
I am interested in a recent comment on the matter by a German
physician living in Mexico City: “Bruck’s work has gone almost
wholly unnoticed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I say to scientific men, that such work deserves to be noticed.
There is new knowledge here, close to the threshold, waiting for
us; and we should not let ourselves be repelled by the seeming
triviality of the phenomena, for it is well known that some of the
greatest discoveries have come from the following up of just such
trivial clews.</p>

<p class='c010'>What did Benjamin Franklin have to go on when he brought
the lightning down from the clouds on the string of a kite? Just
a few hints, picked up in the course of the previous hundred years;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>a few traces of electricity noted by accident. The fact that you got
a spark if you stroked a cat’s fur; the fact that you got the same kind
of a spark by rubbing amber, and a bigger one by storing the energy
in a glass jar lined with tinfoil—that was all men had as promise
of the miracles of our time, dynamos and superpower, telegraph
and telephone, x-ray surgery, radio, wireless, television, and new
miracles just outside our door. If now it be a fact that there is a
reality behind the notions of telepathy and clairvoyance, to which
so many investigators are bearing testimony all over the world, who
can set limits to what it may mean to the future? What new powers
of the human mind, what ability to explore the past and future, the
farthest deeps of space, and those deeps of our own minds, no less
vast and marvelous?</p>

<p class='c010'>To set limits to such possibilities is not to be scientific, it is
merely to be foolish. The true scientist sets no limits to human
powers, he merely asks that we verify our facts. This my wife and
I have tried to do, and I think that, so far as concerns telepathy at
least, we can claim success. We present here a mass of real evidence,
and we shall not be troubled by any amount of ridicule from the
ignorant. I tell you—and because it is so important, I put it in
capital letters: TELEPATHY HAPPENS!</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE SINCLAIR EXPERIMENTS FOR TELEPATHY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>About eighteen months ago I first opened a new book by the
novelist Upton Sinclair, entitled <cite>Mental Radio</cite>, then newly issued.
In 239 pages it outlined the story of the discovery and development
of what purported to be a supernormal faculty possessed by his wife,
and rehearsed a large number of experiments in which she seemed
to have achieved a large and convincing percentage of successes as
a telepathic “percipient,” the “agent” generally being Mr. Sinclair,
but sometimes her brother-in-law or another person. I confess to
misgivings as I began to read, first for the very reason that the writer
is a novelist (unmindful of Wells and certain other writers of fiction
who, nevertheless, have shown themselves capable of serious and
even scientific thinking),<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and secondly because I had suspected,
rightly or wrongly, that once or twice in the past he had failed to
discover the devices of certain clever professionals. To be sure, his
wife was not a professional, and all the conditions could be under
his own hand, but sometimes through sheer confidence people are
deceived by their own relatives.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>This, to be frank, was my initial attitude—one of cautious
interrogation and alertness to find signs of credulity, failure to
appreciate the possibilities of chance, or lack of data by which the
calculus of chance coincidence could be determined. But as I read
on and studied the reproductions of drawings it became more and
more evident that something besides chance had operated, that the
conditions of many of the experiments had been excellently devised,
and that where the conditions were relaxed Mr. Sinclair had
been quite aware of the fact and was candid enough to admit it.
He stated that such relaxation did not increase the percentage of
success, and it certainly so appeared from the examples given. He
reported the total number of experiments, and estimated the percentages
of successes, partial successes, and failures. In 290 experiments,
he made these percentages: successes, approximately 23 per
cent; partial successes, 53 per cent; failures, 24 per cent. He admitted
that judges probably would not agree upon exactly the same
ratios. In fact I personally think that certain examples which he
did not publish are better than a few which he did, but have not
yet found reason to quarrel with his general estimates.</p>

<p class='c010'>After considerable study of the book, becoming interested
beyond any expectation, I wrote to Mr. Sinclair, stating that I had
become favorably impressed, and making the somewhat audacious
proposal that he should send me all the original materials for a
fresh study by the individual standards and through the particular
methods of a professional investigator. One can think of several
reasons which might make the most honest and confident man
hesitant to assent to such a proposal, coming from one whom he
had never seen, and who might for all he knew have a set of prejudices
which after all would cause him to make a lawyer’s argument
against the case. I was really surprised that the bundle of materials
was sent as quickly as it could be gotten together.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Among the objects in mind were: (1) To study the materials
in their strict chronological order, day by day. The mode of presentation
in <cite>Mental Radio</cite> was to give some of the most striking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>results first, then many more that were more or less classified
according to subjects and aspects. This is effective for popular
reading but not satisfactory to the serious student. (2) To see if
there were signs, in any part of the results, of profiting from normal
knowledge, whether consciously or subconsciously acquired, of
what the “agent” had drawn. Mr. Sinclair took this theory into
account and quite decidedly killed it, but it was my duty to try it
out anew by my own processes, with the same rigor shown in relation
to my own wife and my daughter in <cite>The Psychic in the House</cite>.
Later, in summary fashion, these tests will be set forth. (3) To try
out other theories to account for the ratios and degrees of correspondence
between “original drawings” and “reproductions” in
the Sinclair experiments, such as involuntary whispering and
chance coincidence. (4) To make a large number of guessing tests
on the basis of the Sinclair originals, both as a means of deciding
whether the “mere coincidence” theory is tenable (as aforesaid)
and, if it should prove otherwise, in order to make a rough
measurement of the disparity between telepathic results and those
of guessing. (5) In the event that there appeared to be no reasonable
escape from conclusion that telepathy is displayed by the
material, to ascertain (a) whether the telepathic faculty with Mrs.
Sinclair was constant, vacillating, progressively constant, or what;
(b) whether the telepathic impressions came to her in the form of
ideas, images, names or in more than one fashion; (c) whether any
further hints as to the mental processes involved could be discerned
or any particular pieces of information isolated which might be
helpful in this field of study. (6) Finally, to urge readers to institute
experiments of their own, and to give amateurs some directions
as to procedure. If many could be persuaded to start “games”
of this character with their friends, doubtless favorable subjects
could be discovered or developed. Attention being called to these
persons, series of tests could be made with them under conditions
against which none of the old objections could be offered.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c017'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The Sinclair experiments are treated first in this Bulletin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>since they are its chief subject. The drier Historical Notes, presenting
a sketch of the first steps in methodical research relating
to alleged Thought-Transference, with summaries of some of the
classic series of tests, particularly such as are based upon drawings,
are relegated to Part Two. The more earnest and methodical students
of such matters will prefer to read that first.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Upton Sinclair, about fifty-two years old when his book
<cite>Mental Radio</cite> was issued, is, as everyone is supposed to know, one
of the leading novelists of the United States. His stories are all,
or nearly all, characterized by an intense purpose. To those who
claim that art should be exercised only for art’s sake this may be
obnoxious. But from the point of view of this examination of his
book purporting to prove telepathy, the fact that his novels also
attempt to prove something, on the basis of studies made by him,
is quite in his favor.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c017'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Whether he has in fact proved the thesis of
his respective tales is not within our province to determine; we do
propose rigidly to analyze and review his claims to have proved
telepathy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Sinclair is a Socialist, and a very active and prominent
one; he has been Socialist candidate for Congress in New Jersey
and later in California, besides having been Socialist candidate
for the United States Senate and for Governor in the latter-named
State. Political prejudices or predilections should be strictly
excluded from the minds of readers of the book or this review of it.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c017'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
It is another gratifying indication that Mr. Sinclair was not
deterred from publishing <cite>Mental Radio</cite> by the solicitations or
irony of influential friends in his political group, for the scientific
spirit is in part compounded of courage, honesty and candor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Sinclair, née Mary Craig Kimbrough, somewhere about
forty-five years old when the experiments afterwards published
took place, is the daughter of a retired judge, bank president, and
planter of Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c010'>The reader may judge of the quality of her mentality by
reading Appendix 1. That is, in part, the reason that it is printed.
It is a piece of writing by Mrs. Sinclair shortened according to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>permission given. Almost immediately after my suggestion that the
experimental materials should be sent for examination, they were
bundled up and sent, together with some stray scraps, among which
was this unfinished piece of manuscript which, as it proved, the
Sinclairs did not know had been included. In spots the composition
may be a bit diffuse and repetitious, but the woman really
thinks and reasons, which is more than many do.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is in it a sincerity, earnestness and intensity of desire
to know, which can hardly be counterfeited. Its writer fairly rivals
Descartes in her determination to find some salient and secure
spot from which to start in her quest. But in a manner she goes
back farther than Descartes, at least she splits his ultimate in two.
She is satisfied with “I am,” not because “I think,” but because
“I am conscious of thinking”; but she does not so readily grant
the “<em>I</em> think.” She wants to know, “Am <em>I</em> doing all the thinking
I am conscious of?”</p>

<p class='c010'>In fact, the document is so intense in its eagerness to penetrate
the secret of personality in relation to its cosmic environment that
it is almost febrile. At least in its first pages there is something
pathological. To paint life with such dark colors and to dwell
so upon its “discouragements” is not an indication of perfect
health.</p>

<p class='c010'>And yet it is certain that the writer is not self-absorbed. The
painful reactions of the kind which she has experienced, the torture
produced in her by the existence of so much in life that seems
unmeaning and disappointing, she supposes to be quite general
with her fellow-men and so feels a great pity for them. Whereas,
in my belief, while more are complaining than are happy or contented,
it is common to fret because of income taxes, and inability
to wear such fine clothes as those of Mrs. Jones, and cold weather
and squalling cats, and such sordid matters, but uncommon to be
agonized by the desire to fathom the mysteries of the human spirit.</p>

<p class='c010'>The main points of what Mr. Sinclair tells us of the characteristics
of his wife are to be discerned in this revealing manuscript.
He says “She has nothing of the qualities of naïveté and credulity.
She was raised in a family of lawyers and was given the training
and sceptical point of view of a woman of the world. ‘Trust people,
but watch them,’ was old Judge Kimbrough’s maxim, and following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>it too closely has almost made a pessimist of his daughter. In
the course of the last five or six years Craig has acquired a fair-sized
library of books on the mind, both orthodox, scientific, and
‘crank.’ She has sat up half the night studying, marking passages
and making notes, seeking to reconcile various doctrines, to know
what the mind is, and how it works, and what can be done with
it.” This began with a breakdown of health when she was about
forty years old. “A story of suffering needless to go into; suffice
it that she had many ills to experiment upon, and mental control
became suddenly a matter of life and death.” This breakdown, it
is said, resulted directly from “her custom of carrying the troubles
of all who were near her.” She is intensely sympathetic, we are told.
“The griefs of other people overwhelm Craig like a suffocation.”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c017'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>The book relates several spontaneous experiences of Mrs.
Sinclair when she was young and which, taken together, strongly
indicate telepathy. Her husband rightly remarks that it is the
number of such incidents which is impressive; one or two might
well be coincidence. Still the coincidence of being suddenly
impressed that Mr. B, whose home was three hundred miles away,
was at her home where he had never been, and turning back from
a drive and finding him there, even taken by itself, is a very striking
one. Mr. Sinclair himself is witness to the fact that she suddenly,
for no known reason became very much worried about
Jack London, insisting that he was in mental distress, whereas it
proved that London committed suicide at about that time.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such incidents indicate that her experimental successes were
not solely the result of the method which she explains at length,
but that she had an inborn gift from early childhood. Her interest
in that gift seems to have been much stimulated by her acquaintance
with “Jan,” the “young hypnotist” of Appendix I, whose
advent is probably not in that narrative placed in chronological
order. She became convinced that he showed evidence of telepathy,
and tried in turn to ascertain what he was thinking or what he
was doing when absent, and became convinced that many times
she had been successful. Also, “Craig has been able to establish
exactly the same <em>rapport</em> with her husband,” who relates instances.
These were “written down at the time.” So few even intelligent
people do make immediate record of such things that we would
have suspected, even if he had not informed us on another page,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>that he has made a considerable study of the literature of psychic
research.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of these incidents we shall particularly notice here, and
that because Mr. Sinclair himself has either not noticed all of its
evidential value, or has not fully called attention to it.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
[Refer to Figs. 14a and 14b and experiment.]</p>

<p class='c010'>Probably Mr. Sinclair thought it would be sufficiently obvious
to the reader that the first drawing is as similar in shape to a clover
blossom as a person having no gift for drawing would be likely
to make it, in addition to the correspondence of color. But it
should also be remarked that the second drawing is like the flower-head
of the American aloe, as one may see by comparing it with
the cut shown in the article entitled “Agave,” in the <cite>Encyclopedia
Britannica</cite>. The article provokingly fails to tell us what are the
colors of the flower, but the cut shows that it is at least much
lighter above than below.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another incident is remarkable for its apparent revelation of
subconscious mechanisms. Seemingly here Mrs. Sinclair not only
got an impression of what her husband had drawn, but it was
modified by something he was then reading, and that by the aid
of memories from childhood. His drawing represented a football,
“neatly laced up” (Fig. <a href='#fig_15'>15</a>). Hers (Fig. <a href='#fig_15a'>15a</a>) shows a band of exactly
the same shape on a figure not so very far from that of a football,
but with an extension suggesting the head of an animal, and a line
suggesting a leg. And she wrote “Belly-band on calf.”&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wishing to solve the mystery!” But why should the lady have
felt that there was any mystery in her drawing and script, any more
than in the generality of her results? But she evidently did, or she
would not have asked the question. It is one of the most interesting
features of this experiment that she seemed to feel that something
else than the original drawing or her husband’s thoughts about it
was influencing her impression, and suspected that this something
was his contemporaneous reading.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes the apparent telepathy was exercised in a dream,
especially during its latter stage, while the lady was gradually
emerging into full consciousness.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c017'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>
  <h3 class='c018'>The Sinclair-Irwin Long-distance Group of Experiments</h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>On July 8, 1928, the first formal set of experiments with drawings
began, by arrangement between Mrs. Sinclair and the husband
of her younger sister; Robert L. Irwin, “a young American business
man, priding himself on having no ‘crank’ ideas.” The
arrangement was that at a stated hour Mr. Irwin should seat himself
in his home in Pasadena, make a drawing, and then fix his mind
upon the drawing from fifteen to twenty minutes. At the same
hour in her home at Long Beach, twenty-five or thirty miles distant
as the crow flies, Mrs. Sinclair proposed to lie on a couch, in semi-darkness
and with closed eyes, compose her mind according to the
rules she had by this time evolved, and after coming to a decision,
make a drawing corresponding with her mental impression. It
appears that there was one such experiment on July 8, two on the
9th, two on the 10th and one each on the 11th and 13th.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have here, then, a set of seven experiments under ideal
conditions. Since something like thirty miles separated the parties,
there could be no contact, no “involuntary whispering” that would
carry that far and no conceivable other source of information or
material for surmise.</p>

<p class='c010'>1. On July 8, Irwin drew a chair with horizontal bars at the
back (Fig. <a href='#fig_16'>16</a>). Mrs. Sinclair drew first a chair with horizontal bars
(Fig. <a href='#fig_16a'>16a</a>), then a chair with vertical ones. And she distinctly set
down on the same paper her sense of greater satisfaction with her
first drawing, her feeling that the second was not as “Bob” had
drawn it, and her feeling that the second may really express the foot
of his bed. She also set down that his drawing was on “green paper.”
Here is a remarkable combination of impressions: (a) his drawing
on <em>green paper</em>, (b) seen as a <em>chair</em> “on his paper,” (c) his chair with
<em>horizontal bars</em>, (d) her chair with vertical bars <em>perhaps derived
from “his bed-foot.”</em> Even had there been, as there was not, a pre-understanding
that some object familiar in daily life was to be
drawn, to hit exactly the same one would be very unlikely. To do
this and also to get the unusual color of the paper he drew on is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>remarkable. To get all the enumerated particulars exactly correct
is incalculably beyond chance expectation. For he drew a chair,
on green paper, with horizontal bars, then gazed at the chair
through the vertical bars of his bed!&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [Refer to Figs. 16 and
16a and experiment.]</p>

<p class='c010'>She added that she sees a star and straight lines, and draws
the star and the lines, horizontal like those of the chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are several partial correspondences besides those we
have enumerated. Bob did sit at the northeast corner of the dining-room
table. He faced a sideboard (but apparently did not take
anything out of it) where were silver (not glass) candlesticks; there
is a star on the back of the chair; whether any white object was
in front of him as he sat at the table, before lying down on the
bed, is not reported. But it is to be presumed that Mrs. Sinclair
was familiar with his room and furniture, and these particulars
add comparatively little. Once she got the chair, subconscious
memory might supply the star; but it would not give any clue
to the green paper or to his looking through vertical bars.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. On July 9, at the stated hour, Bob drew a watch (Fig. <a href='#fig_17'>17</a>).<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
First Mrs. Sinclair drew a chair, but cancelled it with the words
then written down, “but do not feel it is correct.” Then she drew
Figure 17a.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='c010'>This is not a success, but the flower which is not a flower, the
petals, which are not petals and should be more uniform, the
“metal,” the “wire” (adumbration of the hands?), the “glass circle,”
the bridging across the extremities of the “petals” as if from an
urge toward making a circle, the black center corresponding with
the center post of a watch, taken together are very suggestive.
Other impressions resulted in the addition of an ellipse, a drinking-glass
and a glass pitcher, and Bob did have in front of him a glass
bowl of goldfish, which may have furnished a telepathic hint, but
this is doubtfully evidential.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.  Another experiment was scheduled for the same day. Bob
made an elaborate drawing of a telephone receiver, transmitter,
dial, cord and all. The top part, the transmitter, as drawn, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>strikingly like a round, black, glass ink-bottle, seen with mouth
facing the spectator. Mrs. Sinclair made four drawings. The first
looks like such an ink-bottle seen from the side, and she writes,
“Ink bottle?” The second drawing shows a twisted line attached
to a triangle, reminding one of the twisted telephone cord attached
to a sharp angle of the base, and the third repeats the twisting line.
The fourth inverted is considerably like the base of the telephone.
The correspondences are very suggestive.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. On the 10th, Bob drew, on the back of the paper having
the telephone drawing (he should not have done this), which he
of course saw anew, what is probably intended to represent a
square frame containing a picture, both very black. The percipient
first drew two lines forming an angle and placed in relation to it
about as the dial of the telephone is placed in relation to the angle
of the telephone base, a black disc. Her next and last drawing was
a circle containing about a dozen round spots, as the circular dial
of the telephone contains eight spots.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. On the 10th, also, Bob drew a pair of scissors (Fig. <a href='#fig_18'>18</a>), and
the percipient made two attempts which, taken together, certainly
do sense its parts (Figs. 18a and 18b).</p>

<p class='c010'>6. On the 11th, Bob, whose health had been in bad shape for
several years, made a circle with a compass, of course producing
a hole in the center of it. And this is what Mrs. Sinclair got (Fig.
19a). There is a circle—in fact, a number of them concentrically
arranged—and there is a central dot corresponding to the mark
made by the compass leg. But other impressions came to Mrs. Sinclair,
accompanied by poignant emotions, and she seemed to see
and tried to draw a spreading stain of blood. She wrote her feeling
and her conviction: “All this dark like a stain,—feel it is blood;
that Bob is ill, more than usual.” She did not draw, but directly
told her husband, “I wanted to draw a little hill.” And why all
this? It transpired that while Bob was making the circle he was in
a state of distress, for, he afterwards testified, “I discovered that
I had a hemorrhoid, and couldn’t put my mind on anything but
the thought, ‘My God, my lungs—my kidneys—and now this!’” It
is hardly necessary, perhaps, to point out that a hemorrhoid is like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>a little hill and that one is very likely to bring on hemorrhage,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c017'><sup>[9]</sup></a> so
that this possibility was probably in Bob’s mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Had Mrs. Sinclair been in a laboratory with one professor
of psychology or of physics, and her brother-in-law in another
laboratory with another, not all the apparatus of both laboratories
nor all the ingenuity of both professors could have made the conditions
more rigid, or tested the essence of the matter farther.
There would simply have been the testimony of four persons, two
at each end, and that is exactly what there is. Bob’s affliction was
of sudden occurrence, and the particular terms of Mrs. Sinclair’s
impressions could not have been produced by any hint of knowledge.
His willingness in the interest of psychic research, in order
that this remarkable demonstration of telepathy should not be lost,
to put aside squeamishness, is a rebuke to the human violets who
shrink, for no intelligible reason from allowing evidence to be used
which relates to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. On the 13th, Bob drew a table fork (Fig. <a href='#fig_1'>1</a>), and Mrs. Sinclair,
at the same hour, many miles away, drew nothing but wrote,
“See a table fork. Nothing else.” (Fig. <a href='#fig_1a'>1a</a>.)</p>

<p class='c010'>These seven experiments<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a> are all that were undertaken
between Mrs. Sinclair and her brother-in-law. This is unfortunate,
for it certainly appears from this short but remarkable series as
though they were remarkably suited to each other, for reasons we
cannot yet fathom, for long-distance experiments. But “he found
them a strain,” and since his health was so poor and strains were
most undesirable, we cannot blame him for discontinuing them.</p>

<p class='c010'>One pauses to consider the words “he found them a strain.”
May it be that when experiments reveal thought-transference the
agent generally does feel a strain beyond that involved in merely
gazing at an object and wishing (or willing, or what you please)
that the percipient may get the idea of it. If so, it would seem to
imply, not necessarily some energy proceeding outwardly, but at
any rate some process going on within which causes the special
exhaustion. But no statistics bearing on this question have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>gathered from successful agents. It is one of the many sorts of data
which must be accumulated in the future.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>The Sinclair-Sinclair Group of July 14–29, 1928</h3>

<p class='c019'>We are in two passages told precisely the conditions of this
group of experiments. Since her brother-in-law felt obliged to
withdraw from participation, Mrs. Sinclair asked her husband to
make some drawings.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='c010'>1. July 14. Mr. Sinclair made the above drawing (Fig. <a href='#fig_2'>2</a>), a
very imperfectly constructed six-pointed star. Mrs. Sinclair, reclining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>30 feet away, with a closed door between, produced five drawings
(Fig. <a href='#fig_2a'>2a</a>).<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c017'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Immediately after the agent’s and percipient’s
drawings had been compared, the lady stated that just before starting
to concentrate she had been looking at her drawing of many
concentric circles made on the previous day in the concluding test
of the Sinclair-Irwin group. This was bad method, but we can
hardly regret it, as the sequel is illuminating. At first she got a
tangle of circles: “This turned sideways [thus assuming the shape
of one of the star-points], then took the shape of an arrowhead
[confused notion of the stair-point, one would conjecture], and
then of a letter A [another attempt to interpret the dawning impression],
and finally evolved into a complete star.” The star so
nearly reproduces the oddities of the original star, its peculiar
shape and the direction which its greatest length takes, that had it
been produced in one of the unguarded series, one would have
been tempted to think that the percipient “peeked.” But the original
was actually <em>made</em>, as well as gazed at, behind a closed door,
so that there is no possible basis for imagining any such accident
or any inadvertence on the part of either experimenter.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. July 14. In his room Mr. Sinclair drew the grinning face
of Figure 21, and then Mrs. Sinclair drew in hers Figure 21a. Two
eyes in his, one “eye” in hers. Look at the agent’s drawing upside
down (how can we or he be sure that he did not momentarily
chance to look at it reversed and retain the impression?), and note
the parallels. At the top of his two eyes—at the top of hers one
“eye”; midway in his two small angles indicating the nose—somewhat
above midway in hers, three similarly small angles unclosed
at the apexes; at the bottom of his a crescent-shaped figure to indicate
a mouth, with lines to denote teeth—at the bottom of hers a
like crescent, minus any interior lines. Had the percipient drawn
what would be instantly recognizable as a face, though a face of
very different lines, it would be pronounced a success. But such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>a fact would be very much more likely as a guess than a misinterpreted,
almost identical crescent (she thought it probably a
“moon”), so similar little marks, angularly related (she “supposed
it must be a star”), and an “eye,” all placed as in the original.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. July 17. Mr. Sinclair, lying on a couch in one room, drew
and then gazed at a drawing which can easily be described; it is a
broad ellipse with its major axis horizontal, like an egg lying on its
side, and a smaller and similar one in contact over it. Mrs. Sinclair,
lying on a couch in another room, first drew a broad ellipse
(not quite closed at one end), with major axis horizontal, and
beside it and not quite touching, a somewhat smaller circle not
quite closed at one end. Then she got an impression represented
in a second drawing, four ellipses of equal size, <em>two of them in
contact with each other</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. July 20. Under the same conditions Mr. Sinclair drew two
heavy lines like a capital T. Mrs. Sinclair drew what is like an
interrogation point with misplaced dot, then a reversed S with two
dots enclosed, then an upright cross composed of lines of equal
length, and finally such a cross circumscribed by a tangential
square. Though, as Mr. Sinclair remarks, the cross is the T of the
original with its vertical line prolonged, I should call this experiment
barely suggestive.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. July 20. Under the same conditions Mr. Sinclair drew a
long-handled fork with three short tines. Mrs. Sinclair, to use the
language of her own record, “kept seeing horns,” and she attempted
to draw them. She also “thought once it was an animal’s head with
horns, and the head was on a long stick—a trophy mounted like
this....” But her drawing was like a long-handled fork with two
short tines combining to make a curve very close to that of the two
outer tines of the original.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. July 20. Under the same conditions Mr. Sinclair drew a
cup with a handle. Mrs. Sinclair twice drew a figure resembling
the handle of the original, then the same with an enclosed dot, then
lines parallel and at an angle. She felt confused and dissatisfied.
It is possible that her first impression was derived from the cup,
but we can hardly urge this evidentially.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. July 21. Under the same conditions Mr. Sinclair drew a
man’s face in profile (Fig. <a href='#fig_20'>20</a>). Mrs. Sinclair wrote: “Saw Upton’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>face—saw two half-circles. Then they came together, making full
circle. But I felt uncertain as to whether they belonged together
or not. Then suddenly saw Upton’s profile float across vision.”
Well, Mr. Sinclair is a man, hence his face is a man’s face, and it
was seen in profile like the original drawing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus far there is no gap in the record of this group. There
were experiments on July 27 and 29, but apparently two or more
papers are missing. It is certain that on the 29th, under the same
conditions, Mr. Sinclair drew a smoking cigarette and wrote
beneath it, “My thought, ‘cigarette with curls for smoke,’” and
that Mrs. Sinclair drew a variety of curving lines and wrote, “I
can’t draw it, but curls of some sort.” So it appears that on this
date there was a suggestive result, but as there is doubt whether
one or two other experiments may not have been tried, the papers
of which were not all preserved, we had better regard the group
as closed with No. 7.</p>

<p class='c010'>So far as concerns the question solely whether Mrs. Sinclair
has shown telepathic powers, I would be willing to rest the case
right here, after but fourteen experiments under the conditions
which have been stated.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c017'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Every intelligent reader who really
applies his mind to them must see the extreme unlikelihood that
the results of those fourteen experiments, taking them as they
stand, successes, partial successes, suggestive and failures, are the
products of chance. And any one who has had hundreds of experiments
in guessing, as I have done, will know that there is no likelihood
of getting out of many thousands of guesses anything like the
number and grades of excellence in correspondence found in these
fourteen consecutive tests for telepathy.</p>

<p class='c010'>We cannot take space to comment on all the tests made, the
papers of which were sent us, and we here pass over three on as
many dates, one a success though not a perfect one, two failures.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>The Series of January 28, 1929</h3>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Sinclair asked his secretary “to make simple geometrical
designs, letters and figures, thinking that these would be easier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>to recognize and reproduce.” It seems a little strange that when
things were going on so well, he should have wanted a change,
though any experiment is interesting. It is by no means certain,
and I very much doubt from these and earlier printed experiments,
that the assumption is a correct one. It may well be that geometrical
diagrams, letters of the alphabet and such like fail to
interest the agent and afford him a lively mental representation,
as do pictures of miscellaneous objects. And if I understand rightly,
another change of method was also initiated, and that was for Mrs.
Sinclair to try to get the drawings not while the maker of them
was gazing intently at them, but after they had left his hands. This
certainly was often the case later on.</p>

<p class='c010'>I wrote and asked Mr. Sinclair if Mrs. Sinclair was told the
fact that this and several other series of original drawings consisted
of geometrical drawings, letters and figures, and he said that she
was not so told, that he would have regarded this as a vitiation of
the experiments. It would certainly increase the chance of getting
drawings right by guess, but it would hardly have ruined the experiments.
In fact, some people think that the most scientific experiments
are those in which the range of chance guess is limited to an
extent known to the percipient, as when the problem is to determine
which of the 52 cards of a pack is being looked at, or which
of only ten known diagrams. This opinion is probably based on
the fact that then the ratio of success to chance expectation can be
exactly calculated, though why it should be more satisfactory to
know that the chance of a correct guess is exactly 1 in 10 than it is
not to be able to tell exactly what the chance is but to be sure at
least that it cannot be 1 in 100, I do not know.</p>

<p class='c010'>Unless I had carefully recorded at the time that there was no
chance of the percipient having a hint that the drawings were now
for a time to consist of geometrical designs, letters and figures, I
would not dare to be certain of it after several years have passed.
If Mrs. Sinclair had no inkling, the change in the general character
of her drawings is a fact of great interest. But we will take cognizance
only of whatever resemblance may or may not be found
between the several reproductions and their originals.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first series of drawings by the secretary were seven in
number, and, says Mr. Sinclair, “They brought only partial successes;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Craig would get elements of the drawing, but would not
know how to put them together.... There is some element right
in every one.” Let us see.</p>

<p class='c010'>1. <em>Agent’s</em> drawing, a script B; <em>Percipient’s</em> drawing, a figure
very like a script 3, practically the B without its vertical line.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <em>Agt.</em>, a script S; <em>Per.</em>, a script J. As made, each has two
balloon-like parts joined at the small ends, certain details of course
different.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <em>Agt.</em>, a hexagon; <em>Per.</em>, two lines forming an acute angle,
like two sides of the hexagon, also a capital E with a line drawn
down at an acute angle to the left from the upper extremity of the
vertical line.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <em>Agt.</em>, script M made with a peculiar twist in its first line;
<em>Per.</em>, almost precisely that first line with its twist.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <em>Agt.</em>, a thin, long, quadrilateral, like a shingle; <em>Per.</em>, (1st
drawing) what would be almost exactly the same quadrilateral,
narrow and long, but its shorter sides are wanting, and (2nd drawing)
a closely similar quadrilateral, with another and longer one
attached to its side at a sharp angle.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <em>Agt.</em>, an interrogation point; <em>Per.</em>, a figure hard to describe,
a round dot with curves springing from it like concentric 3’s, and
two parallel lines shooting to the left. The points which attract
notice are the dot, like that of the original, and the curves similar
to that of the interrogation point.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. <em>Agt.</em>, script E; <em>Per.</em>, same minus the “curls.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Several of the above are not impressive taken alone; taken
together, the greater or less approaches to the several originals
defeat chance, though how much no man can measure. Counter-tests
by guessing will come the nearest to measuring.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>The Series of January 28–29, 1929</h3>

<p class='c019'>This series also has to do with drawings made by Mr. Sinclair’s
secretary.</p>

<p class='c010'>1. <em>Agent’s</em> drawing, a diamond or rhombus (Fig. <a href='#fig_32'>32</a>); <em>Percipient’s</em>
drawing, the two halves of a rhombus, “wandering about,”
as Mr. Sinclair says (Fig. <a href='#fig_32a'>32a</a>); if connected they would make a
rhombus closely similar to the original.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>2. <em>Agt.</em>, a script capital Y; <em>Per.</em>, a print capital Y. (Figs. 33
and 33a.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3. The <em>Agent’s</em> drawing, a bottle of milk with “certified”
written on it, was suggested by his knowledge that Mrs. Sinclair
to a considerable extent lives on milk and is particular about its
quality; <em>Per.</em>, an ellipse much like the top of the bottle, a straight
line depending therefrom, and the script “Round white foamy
stuff on top like soapsuds or froth.” And foam is characteristic
of her milk, as she drinks it sour and whipped (Figs. 34 and 34a).
Here the percipient failed to get much as to shape, but got considerable
in the way of associated ideas.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <em>Agt.</em>, an oil derrick (Fig. <a href='#fig_35'>35</a>); <em>Per.</em>, got what will be seen
in Figure 35a. There are long lines diverging like the long lines
of the oil derrick, but at a slant, and with a 5 or perhaps a 9 at the
top which has no counterpart in the original. This is not a very
satisfactory reproduction, but the general shape and long downward
lines are suggestive.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <em>Agt.</em>, something like a poplar leaf; <em>Per.</em>, three scrawls like
letters or parts of letters. A failure.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <em>Agt.</em>, three small ellipses attached to a stem; <em>Per.</em>, script
“See what looks like spider’s web,” but drawing shows a bunch of
elliptic figures.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. <em>Agt.</em>, apparently an apple with stem; <em>Per.</em>, (1) what looks
like a tall script V, (2) the same less tall, (3) one so low and broad
that it is nearly equivalent to the top of the apple minus the stem.</p>

<p class='c010'>8. <em>Agt.</em>, a house from whose chimney proceeds smoke represented
by a spiral line (Fig. <a href='#fig_36'>36</a>). <em>Per.</em>, (1) a double spiral cut by a
straight line, same slant as in the original, (2) single spiral of nearly
the same slant, (3) what looks like a battlement, the crenels or
openings of which are like the windows of the house minus the
upper sides (Fig. <a href='#fig_36a'>36a</a>). The rectangular openings are three in
number, the rectangular openings in the house (two windows and
a door) are also there.</p>

<p class='c010'>9. <em>Agt.</em>, an open fan (Fig. <a href='#fig_102'>102</a>); <em>Per.</em>, a drawing represented
by Figure 102a, accompanied by the script, “Inside seems irregular,
as if cloth draped or crumpled.” Two words, “cloth,” and
“draped,” suggest what takes place as one begins to shut a fan,
though the drawing is an incorrect representation.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>10. <em>Agt.</em>, the figures 13 (Fig. <a href='#fig_103'>103</a>); <em>Per.</em>, (1) what would be a 3
but for a supernumerary curve, (2) a 3 (Fig. <a href='#fig_103a'>103a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>11. <em>Agt.</em>, a conventional heart (Fig. <a href='#fig_105'>105</a>); <em>Per.</em>, practically
the upper part of such a heart, with three spots which may or may
not represent blood-drops, according to Mr. Sinclair’s conjecture
(Fig. <a href='#fig_105a'>105a</a>). We can hardly contend, as an evidential point, that
this is the meaning of the round spots. Some obscure subconscious
recollection of expressions like “My heart bleeds,” expressing suffering,
may have come out in the drawing, though in that case
one wonders why the whole heart was not drawn. But it may be
that the three marks proceeding in the direction of the right side
of the original came from a feeling that <em>something</em> should line in
that direction.</p>

<p class='c010'>12. <em>Agt.</em>, a broom (Fig. <a href='#fig_104'>104</a>); <em>Per.</em>, several attempts all more
or less resembling the original (Figs. <a href='#fig_104a'>104a</a>, <a href='#fig_104b'>104b</a>), and a valuable
script: “All I’m sure of is a straight line with something curved
at the end of it [and this description, <em>all that she was sure of</em>, is so
far correct]; once it came [here see the drawing at the left]—then
it doubled, or reappeared, I don’t know which [referring to the
upper right drawing] (am not sure of the curly edges) [and she was
justified in her doubt. Probably the curly edges resulted from
the intermingling of her surmise that the curved something at the
end of a line might be a flower]. Then it was upside down.”</p>

<h3 class='c021'>Series of February 8, 1929</h3>

<p class='c019'>Tests with drawings in carefully sealed envelopes.</p>

<p class='c010'>1. <em>Agt.</em>, a coiled snake (Fig. <a href='#fig_45'>45</a>); <em>Per.</em>, no drawing, but this
script: “See something like kitten with tail and saucer of milk.
Now it leaps into action and runs away to outdoors. Turns to
fleeing animal outdoors. Great activity among outdoor creatures.
Know it’s some outdoor thing, not indoor object—see trees, and
a frightened bird on the wing (turned sidewise). It’s outdoor thing,
but none of above seems to be <em>it</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This is much more interesting than if there had been the
perfect success of writing the word “snake,” because we seem to get
inklings of the internal process. “Saucer of milk”—observe that the
serpent’s coil plus the unattached ellipse in the center (due to Mr.
Sinclair’s confessed bad drawing) really does look like a saucer.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“Something like a kitten with a tail”—why mention tail? Most kittens
have tails. But a tail sticks up back of the saucer. Later neither
kitten, trees nor frightened bird is <em>it</em>, yet something is causing great
commotion among outdoor creatures. It is an outdoor thing, therefore
not a kitten, but evidently something alive. The scene is very
appropriate to the appearance of a snake. Mr. Sinclair tells us that
his wife’s childhood was in part spent where there were many poisonous
snakes, and that fear of them was bred in her. As he conjectures,
it is very likely that dawning in the subconsciousness, not
fully emerging in the conscious, the subject of the drawing stirred
up imagery from childhood. I surmise that, if the truth, which she
may not consciously remember, could be known, she saw while a
child a kitten fleeing from a snake.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <em>Agt.</em>, a daisy (Fig. <a href='#fig_59'>59</a>); <em>Per.</em> got what is very like the petals
around the disk of the daisy, also two stems, also various curving
lines more or less like the daisy leaves or vegetation at least (Fig.
59a).</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <em>Agt.</em>, an axe, seemingly a battle-axe, with AX printed (Fig.
145); <em>Per.</em>, as in Figure 145a. Note the parallels: (a) “letter A [right
as far as it goes], (b) with something long (c) above it”; (d) “there
seems to be no end to the handle”; (e) the drawing much resembles
the original, in fact one type of ancient battle-axe was very much
of the same shape. Although she finally guessed that it was a key,
yet a suspicion of military use enters in the conjecture “a sword,”
which is perhaps all the more striking since the drawing bears little
resemblance to a sword.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <em>Agt.</em>, a crab (Fig. <a href='#fig_48'>48</a>); <em>Per.</em> drew as in Figures 48a, 48b, and
wrote “Wings, or fingers—wing effect, but no feathers, things like
fingers, instead of feathers. Then many little dots which all disappear,
and leave two of them, O O, as eyes of something.” And again,
“streamers flying from something.” The reader will judge for himself
whether the drawings do not suggest the crab’s nippers, and one
of them the joint adjoining. “Wing effect but no feathers, things
like fingers”—especially the lower pair in Mr. Sinclair’s remarkable
crab <em>do</em> look like fingers. “Many dots”; well the original has four.
Then she sees but two of them and they are “O O, eyes of something.”
True enough, two of the “dots” in the crab are O O, and
they are eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>5. <em>Agt.</em>, a man in a sledge driving a dog-team (Fig. <a href='#fig_60'>60</a>). <em>Per.</em> by
accident opened this drawing, so of course could not experiment
with it. But after she had made her drawings for No. 2 she wrote
“Maybe snow scene on hill with a sled.” On the back of No. 3,
which was so brilliant a success, she wrote “I get a feeling again of
a snow scene to come in this series—a sled in the snow.” It is unfortunate
that an accident prevented her trying No. 5 when she
had actually reached it, but she certainly got it by anticipation.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <em>Agt.</em>, a tobacco pipe with smoke issuing therefrom (Fig.
37); Per. first drew an ellipse and wrote “Now it begins to spin,
round and round, and is attached to a stick”; (2) next she made the
conventional “curl” which usually means smoke; (3) then she made
another curl of smoke and pushed the open end of an ellipse into
it,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c017'><sup>[13]</sup></a> joined a line to the ellipse just about where the stem of a pipe
meets the bowl and at the end of the line made a small circle, which
certainly is not found in the original but may express the feeling
that there is a circular opening (Fig. <a href='#fig_37a'>37a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>7. <em>Agt.</em>, a house with smoking chimney; <em>Per.</em>, two figures, each
very like the frame of a window lacking the upper side, or like the
crenels or openings in the battlement of Figure 36a, but longer. In
connection with that drawing (Experiment of January 28–29) we
made the remark (which may have seemed fanciful) that the number
of these openings or uncompleted rectangles was the same as
that of the windows and door in the original drawing. Here the
uncompleted 2 rectangles equal in number the one window plus the
one door of the house. She also wrote “There is something above
this—can’t see what it is part of.” True, the roof and chimney are
above the window and door.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>Series of February 10, 1929</h3>

<p class='c019'>1. <em>Agt.</em>, a bat (Fig. <a href='#fig_109'>109</a>); <em>Per.</em>, as in Fig 109a. The drawing at
the top is accompanied by the remark “Looks like ear shape something.”
And certainly each of the bat’s wings does resemble an
ear in shape. The middle left drawing gets the idea that there are
two symmetrical and diverging curves, but fails to complete them;
space is left between them which in the agent’s drawing is occupied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>by the body. The middle right figure again has symmetrical diverging
curves, with a further approach toward shaping the wings. This
time they are incorrectly joined at the bottom, but the perpendicular
line between betrays an inkling that something belongs
there. Imperfect as all these attempts are, they contain hints which
it is difficult to attribute to chance. The agent, looking at his drawing,
would of necessity have his attention focus first on one part
of it and then upon another, and the percipient’s drawings seem as
though they caught his several moments of wandering attention.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <em>Agt.</em>, a hand with pointing finger, and thumb held vertically
(Fig. <a href='#fig_108'>108</a>); <em>Per.</em>, (1) a drawing not reproduced here of a negro’s head
with a finger-like projection drawn vertically from his skull, (2)
then script “Turned into a pig’s head, (3) then a rabbit’s,” as in
Figure 108a. In one sense the <em>percipient’s</em> drawings are all failures;
that is, none of them would be recognized as a hand. But in all
three a feeling seems to express itself that there is <em>something</em> sticking
up. This is the more remarkable in Drawing 1, since such an excrescence
does not belong on a head. Drawing 2 gets rid of the face,
and the thumb of the original becomes a peculiarly thumb-like ear.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. For this experiment see the “line-and-circle men” and their
evidentially suggestive sequel (Figs. <a href='#fig_144'>144</a>, <a href='#fig_144a'>144a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <em>Agt.</em>, a rudely drawn caterpillar (Fig. <a href='#fig_118'>118</a>); <em>Per.</em>, script:
“Fork—then garden tool—lawn rake. Leaf,” and drawing representing
a leaf which has a certain fantastic resemblance to the
caterpillar (Fig. <a href='#fig_118a'>118a</a>). Mr. Sinclair makes the illuminating remark
that he owned “a lawn-rake made of bristly bamboo, which looks
very much like my drawing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <em>Agt.</em>, a smoking volcano (Fig. <a href='#fig_25'>25</a>); <em>Per.</em>, what she called a
“Big black beetle with horns” (Fig. <a href='#fig_25a'>25a</a>). But the body of the beetle
closely matches the smoke of the volcano, while the antennae or
“horns” nearly correspond to the outline of the mountain.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>A Series of February 15, 1929<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c017'><sup>[14]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c019'>Let us now inspect a complete and long series of February 15,
1929. It contains no such brilliant success as in Experiment 4 of
February 20, but out of 13 experiments there is but one absolute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>failure, the first. In this the agent drew a rat, the percipient two
crossed objects like keys.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. In Figure 147, the agent’s drawing represents a door with
lattice on the upper half; it is made up of perpendicular and horizontal
lines only. The percipient’s drawing (Fig. <a href='#fig_147a'>147a</a>) consists of
four perpendicular lines finishing at the top in curves like fish-hooks,
and these lines are crossed by three horizontal lines. There
is in the crossed lines a suggestion of the agent’s drawing, a resemblance
greater than to any other of the thirteen.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. The agent’s next drawing (Fig. <a href='#fig_93'>93</a>) represents a sun over
hills. Mrs. Sinclair first seems to have got the notion of a sun, which
was right (Fig. <a href='#fig_93a'>93a</a>). Then she made another circle and put features
in it, as will be seen suggested in the agent’s drawing (actually, in
the original drawing, the features are plainly to be seen). Then
she got the idea of something stretching out below it with curving
lines, interpreted it to be a body, so probably, from mere inference,
clapped her sun with features on to it.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. Agent’s Figure 97 is a butterfly but the percipient did not
get the idea of a butterfly (Fig. <a href='#fig_97a'>97a</a>). However, the divergent lines
and the spots, five instead of four, and similarly placed, do seem
to bear a relation to it.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. In Figure 96a, Mrs. Sinclair’s drawing resembles a part of
her husband’s (Fig. <a href='#fig_96'>96</a>), although she misinterpreted her mental
picture. What she thought to be the leg of an animal, and which
she drew twice, was judged by the way it bends to be a front one,
but the knee of the leg roughly corresponds with the elbow of the
pipe. Note that she seems to have got the bulge at the end of the
pipe, translating it into a “foot,” naturally at the end of the leg.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>6. In Figures 98 and 98a, compare the three “sparks” with the
three crosses on the box.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. The shape of Figure 94a is like that of Figure 94 reversed,
and there is a suggestion of the strings, while the feet represent the
pedals of the harp.</p>

<p class='c010'>8. The percipient in the case of Figure 95a did not get the
picture of the whole balloon bag of the agent (Fig. <a href='#fig_95'>95</a>), but she did
of half of it, with a strong suggestion of the cords.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>9. In Figure 148a, bad as the percipient’s drawings are, regarded
as reproductions of Figure 148, yet they do contain suggestions
of it. In her left upper drawing we may suppose that an
impression of the leaf-stem (but badly twisted) was expressed with
a leaf-lobe directly below the stem, together with an idea of the
veining, that in the right upper one the stem is corrected, and that
in the lower drawing a notion of the veining alone is conveyed.
Exactly so would the attention of the agent, when drawing the leaf
or afterward looking at or thinking of it, pass from and to, or at
least stress, one part of the leaf after another.</p>

<p class='c010'>10. The agent drew a necktie (Fig. <a href='#fig_90'>90</a>). The percipient first
drew what much resembled the necktie, even to the shaded knot
(not given here), and almost exactly like Figure 90a aside from the
“smoke.” Next she wrote “Then it began to smoke,” and drew as
in Figure 90a. One would suppose that the knobby extremity and
the diverging lines suggested a burning match.</p>

<p class='c010'>11. But no, the alteration appears to have been an anticipation
of the agent’s next drawing, already prepared (Fig. <a href='#fig_91'>91</a>)! In this case
Mrs. Sinclair achieved a complete success (Fig. <a href='#fig_91a'>91a</a>), though she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>distrusted it, writing beside the drawing, “Must be memory of the
last one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>12. In Figure 92a the percipient got the first two links of the
agent’s chain (Fig. <a href='#fig_92'>92</a>) fairly well. The succeeding ones are suggested
by a series of partially superposed ovals, owing to misinterpretation
of her impressions. She wrote: “An egg-shaped thing
smoking? Anyway, curls of something coming out of end of egg.”
Note that her combined “egg” and “curls” describe a curve similar
to that of the chain, and one not far from the same length.</p>

<p class='c010'>13. The last experiment of this date resulted in two percipient
drawings (Fig. <a href='#fig_149a'>149a</a>), similar but with differences as noted below.
Presumably the “arm” of the upper drawing is a reflection of the
neck of the violin (Fig. <a href='#fig_149'>149</a>), the “hand” of its bridge, the “strings”
of the violin strings, while the “something” very imperfectly stands
for the body of the instrument. The bracelet (?) on the arm may
result from an obscure impression of <em>something</em> curving in that
region, really the volute termination above the keys. The lower
drawing stops with the strings, but makes them more nearly parallel,
like those of the violin.</p>

<p class='c010'>No exact mathematics can be applied to such experiments as
these. But, considering the multitude of objects and shapes which
must have been familiar to both experimenters, do you believe that
there was 1 chance in 16 of the successes in Experiments 10, 11 and
12? Or more than 1 chance in 4 for Experiments 5, 6 and 7? Or
more than an average of 1 in 2 for such small degree of success as
is discoverable in the rest, excluding the failure of the first? Multiply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>accordingly, and divide the product, let us say, by 2 for this
failure. The result, on what I think a moderate basis, is 1 chance
in 16,777,216. Figure any other way you like, but be reasonable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Or substitute the first above percipient drawing for that in
any and every one of the above 12 pairs. Then take the next drawing
and match it with the other originals. And thus with the others,
if your patience holds out to the end of 132 exchanges. Have you
found a single one which will suit as well as in its actual position?</p>

<h3 class='c018'>COUNTER-TESTS WHICH PROVE THE VAST DISPARITY BETWEEN THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE SERIES OF FEBRUARY 15TH AND THOSE OBTAINED BY GUESSING</h3>

<p class='c019'>It is proposed at this point to interrupt the review of Mr.
Sinclair’s report of his experiments for telepathy by a test applied
to the series which has just been exhibited. In the light of the test,
as it proves, the evidential weight of both the earlier series and
those which will come later ought to be better appreciated. The
only way to explain (?) such results is to hazard the conjecture that
they were due to the possibilities of chance guessing. Well then,
let us have a lot of guessing done on the basis of the same originals
and see what we get and how it compares.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c017'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>It seems almost incredible that any intelligent person would
hold, or suggest it possible, that the several degrees of resemblance
between 12 of the 13 originals in this series and the reproductions
could have come about by chance guessing. Surely, no one possessing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>an average quality of logical and mathematical faculty, if he
takes time to consider, will be guilty of so monstrous a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux pas</span></i> of
the intellect. But experience teaches that some, even of excellent
academic or professional standing, to whom the notion of the possibility
of telepathy has long been obnoxious, are indeed capable of
dismissing an exhibit such as this after a passing glance, with the
exclamation, “Merely chance coincidence.” It is well, then, to
make a large number of experiments in order to test the chances of
chance-coincidence to produce such a result. Perhaps, after that
is done, even those most convinced that chance cannot account for
such correspondences as we have seen will be astonished to find
the extent to which results where telepathy has played a part and
results of mere guessing differ.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ten ladies offered themselves for experimentation. Of course
the likelihood was very small that any one of them would show a
trace of telepathic faculty. As it proved, there developed no reason
to suspect its possession by a single one of them. And it is certain
that no one who disbelieves that <em>any one</em> gets impressions by telepathy
will complain of our conclusion that the ten ladies did nothing
more than guess.</p>

<p class='c010'>If they did nothing more than to guess, it made no difference
what method we employed, so long as the ladies were given no inkling
of the original drawings. Nevertheless, the exact replicas of
Mr. Sinclair’s 13 drawings of February 15th were separately sealed
in numbered envelopes, and the lady was asked to hold the envelopes,
one by one, in her hand, and to draw what came into her
mind visually or by concept, choosing from such impressions according
to vividness, recurrence or by whatever criterion seemed
to her most congenial. She was told to take all the time she wished
and was then left alone. Thus the conditions of the Sinclair experiments
were imitated as closely as possible. The time occupied by
the ladies for the series varied from half an hour to nearly an hour
and a half. Every woman would have been pleased, naturally, if
her results had been such as to give grounds for suspecting telepathy,
but the results of the ladies differed in quality only by narrow
degrees, and, as said, there was not the slightest reason to suppose
that with any of them there was anything but chance in play.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>It is, of course, not practicable to reproduce their 130 drawings
in this Bulletin. But they are to be mounted, the ten for each
original drawing on a separate sheet together with a copy of the
Sinclair original and reproduction, and the 13 sheets will be preserved
by the Boston Society for Psychic Research as a permanent
exhibit which any visitor may inspect and judge for himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>As has been seen, we classified the Sinclair reproductions of
this series as Successes, Partial Successes, Suggestive and Failures.
This is a rough method, and others might increase or decrease the
number assigned to any of these classes, except the last. There can
be no question that there is but one entire failure. But however
faulty our standard of rating, it is the same standard which is applied
to the drawings of the ten ladies.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not only did I use the utmost care in rating the drawings of the
ten ladies, but I asked my secretary, Miss Hoffmann, a lady of education
and keen intelligence, to do the same. Her rating of the
guessing sets was as absolutely independent of mine as mine was
independent of hers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our mutually independent estimates were surprisingly alike.
According to both, there were among the 130 trials (by 10 women)
not a single Success, only 1 (Miss H) or 2 (W. F. P.) deserving to
be entitled to Partial Success, 7 Suggestive, 5 Slightly Suggestive
and 116 (W. F. P.) or 117 (Miss H) Failure. Compare with the
Sinclair set, 3 Success, 5 Partial Success, 4 Suggestive, 1 Failure, out
of a total of but 13.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before the foregoing judging was done, I had Miss Hoffman
guess the whole set, twice a day, until another 10 sets were produced,
based upon the same Sinclair series. Our wholly independent
estimates of the total results of these additional 130 experiments
in guessing proved again to be surprisingly alike. Neither
found a single Success, 1 (W. F. P.) or no (Miss H) reproduction
deserved to be called a Partial Success, 5 (W. F. P.) or 7 (Miss H)
were rated Suggestive, 8 (W. F. P.) or 7 (Miss H) as Slightly Suggestive
and 116 as Failures.</p>

<p class='c010'>We will now tabulate the two groups (the sets of the 10 ladies
and Miss H’s 10 sets), taken together (260 experiments in guessing).</p>

<p class='c010'>But there is perhaps a surer way of making comparisons. It is
sometimes difficult to draw the line between a Success and a Partial
Success, a Partial Success and a Suggestive, a Suggestive and a
Slightly Suggestive. But when the drawings represent not simple
diagrams, but objects animate and inanimate, and a reproduction
by Mrs. Sinclair is placed beside a like-numbered one in any of the
20 guessing sets, it is very seldom that one cannot be certain whether
one is better as compared with the common original, and within
fair limits how much better. And the proof of this statement is
found in the fact that when two persons passed upon the 20 sets of
guessing reproductions, comparing them with the 1 set of Sinclair
reproductions, to determine, case for case, in 260, which were more
nearly like the originals, and to what degree, their rating was almost
identical, although they worked in entire and absolute mutual
independence of each other.</p>

<p class='c010'>W. F. P. found the guessing reproduction of experiment 1 to
be bad to a degree equal with the Mrs. Sinclair failure, in 16 instances.
Miss Hoffmann found it equally bad also in 16 instances,

<p class='c010'>It is almost incredible that two human beings could come to
so close an agreement, unless one had some clue to the opinions of
the other, but it is even so, no smallest hint passed in either direction.
The fact is that in very few instances can there be the slightest
hesitancy in deciding which is nearer the common original, the
Sinclair or the guessing reproduction.</p>

<p class='c010'>If there is any reproduction of the Sinclair series whose resemblance
to the original might seem illusory it is that coupling with
the leaf of a tree or plant (Figs. <a href='#fig_148'>148</a>, <a href='#fig_148a'>148a</a>). But of the 20 guesses of
that original not one is so near; in 18 instances (W. F. P.) or at least
15 (Miss H) Mrs. Sinclair’s is very much the better, in 1 (W. F. P.)
to 3 (Miss H) it is much better, and in 1 (W. F. P.) or 2 (Miss H) it
is better.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps some persons would think that such resemblance as
there is between the butterfly and Mrs. Sinclair’s reproduction
(Figs. <a href='#fig_97'>97</a>, <a href='#fig_97a'>97a</a>) is too faint to count, or at least is accidental. But, by
the independent judgment of two persons, not a single one of the
corresponding guessing reproductions is as near the original or
anything like so near.</p>

<p class='c010'>Or one might sneer at calling Mrs. Sinclair’s reproduction of
Figure 147 “Suggestive.” Only 5 vertical lines, wrongly curving at
the top, crossed by three lines, to stand for a “door with hinges,
lower sash,” and wire screen covering the upper half! But not a
single one of the 20 guesses approaches so much resemblance. Miss
H says that of 19 of these, and W. F. P. of 16, “Si.v.m.b.” Miss H
says of 1, W. F. P. of 2, “Si.m.b.,” while W. F. P. at least is sure of
his remaining 2, “Si.b.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>In the light of such tests as those just now made, even such
degrees of resemblance as we have found in the very weakest numbers
of the 13 in this Sinclair series take on deep significance. And
the whole mass of our counter-experiments clearly indicates that
the reproductions by Mrs. Sinclair in that series are prodigiously
beyond the reach of chance guessing.</p>

one which made the nearest, though so distant, approach to success.
Let the reader compare her drawings, one by one, with the reproductions
of Mrs. Sinclair, and judge for himself both which were

<h4 class='c029'>A Series of February 17, 1929<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c017'><sup>[16]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c019'>The conditions under which this series of experiments was
conducted were excellent, and will be given partly in Mr. Sinclair’s
words and partly, for greater conciseness, abridged from his statement,
aided by an examination of the materials.</p>

<p class='c010'>(a) The original drawings were made by Mr. Sinclair when he
was alone in his study. (b) They were made on green paper. (c)
Each drawing was enclosed “in a separate sheet of green paper.”
(d) Each drawing with its enclosing sheet was folded once, making
four thicknesses. (e) And each pair of sheets, that with the drawing
and the blank outside one, was put in an envelope [Experiment
shows that not even when held up to a strong light can a drawing
made and enclosed in such paper and placed in an envelope be seen
at all]. (f) The envelope was sealed. (g) The nine sealed envelopes
were laid on the table by Mrs. Sinclair’s couch. (h) Her procedure
was to put an envelope, and each in turn as the tests proceeded,
over her solar plexus, and when she had made her decision, to sit
up and draw upon a paper pad. (i) Meanwhile, at her own insistence,
Mr. Sinclair watched her throughout. (j) “Never did she
see my drawing,” he declares, “until hers was completed and her
descriptive words written.” (k) “I spoke no word and made no
comment until after this was done.” He adds: “The drawings
represented here are in every case exactly what I drew, and the
corresponding drawing is exactly what my wife drew, with no
change or addition whatsoever.”</p>

<p class='c010'>1. <em>Agt.</em>, a geographical globe; <em>Per.</em>, an obscure drawing most
probably representing the head and neck of some animal. Failure.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c017'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>2. <em>Agt.</em>, a wall-hook (Fig. <a href='#fig_123'>123</a>); <em>Per.</em>, the drawing of Figure
123a, which resembles the original to a certain limited degree,
having a narrow extension to the left though not curving, and
broadening to the right with a suggestion of curving at the bottom.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <em>Agt.</em>, a monkey hanging from a bough and grasping at another
(Fig. <a href='#fig_24'>24</a>); <em>Per.</em> drew as in Figures 24a, 24b (except that in the
former the cut fails to give all of the pencil drawing. Instead of four
curving lines hanging from the flower or whatever it is, the ends
of each pair should be united by a curve) and it seems as though
elements of the original were caught but misplaced. Each figure
is of the shape of the under branch in the original drawing, but with
the slant of the monkey; there are two as-it-were arms reaching
down instead of one; and while the drawings do not suggest any
animal, the script begins “Buffalo or lion. Tiger,” and concludes
with the conviction that there is at least some “wild animal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <em>Agt.</em>, man and woman standing together; <em>Per.</em>, two drawings,
one almost exactly the shape of the woman’s skirt, with two
black spots below and touching its bottom line, exactly as the feet
of the woman appear below her skirt; the other drawing similar but
less like the original.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <em>Agt.</em>, an animal shape, probably intended for a goat (certain
species, as the Angora, have long horns which resemble those of the
drawing, and goats generally have a short tail) (Fig. <a href='#fig_138'>138</a>); <em>Per.</em>, no
drawing, but the single word “Goat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <em>Agt.</em>, a mandolin, its neck drawn with several parallel lines,
the body of the instrument composed of four curving lines with
three straight ones for the strings; <em>Per.</em>, what may perhaps be intended
for a flower, but its long stem indicated by several parallel
lines and its blossom drawn with curving and straight lines constitute
a strong resemblance, and entitle it to be regarded a partial
success.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>7. <em>Agt.</em>, a nearly round bag with a dollar mark on it, pursed
and drawn up on top, as by a string; <em>Per.</em>, (1) a circle with a vertical
line protruding from its upper edge, (2) a cup-like figure with a
line from its bottom to above its upper edge.</p>

<p class='c010'>8. <em>Agt.</em>, a Lima bean (?); <em>Per.</em>, a head wearing a turban, which
in shape is conspicuously like the bean.</p>

<p class='c010'>9. <em>Agt.</em>, a nest containing seven eggs and surrounded by leaves
(Fig. <a href='#fig_4'>4</a>); <em>Per.</em>, a drawing which she interpreted as “Inside of rock
well with vines climbing on outside,” but which presents features
startlingly like the original (Fig. <a href='#fig_4a'>4a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>There is the outer rim, like that of the nest, and which would
probably have completed the circle if the top of the paper had not
been reached. There are the “stones,” for some unknown reason
obscured in the cut but some of them in the center showing more
plainly and more regularly ovoid in the pencil drawing, resembling
the eggs of the original. And there are not only surrounding leaves
as in the original, but they are leaves of similar shape.</p>

<h4 class='c029'>Series of February 20, 1929</h4>

<p class='c019'>There were four experimental tests made this day, the same
when the remarkable case of spontaneous telepathy occurred, in
which Mrs. Sinclair sensed that her husband was reading about
flowers and described them by drawings and script (p. <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In the 1st, Mr. Sinclair drew a fire hydrant (Fig. <a href='#fig_74'>74</a>); Mrs. Sinclair
drew as in Figure 74a. This was certainly a partial success, as
the drawings compare. And for aught we know it may in fact have
been a still better success, since Mr. Sinclair in looking at his drawing
may well have imagined water bursting forth from the spout
of the hydrant. Oddly, Mrs. Sinclair first wrote “Peafowl,” and
then drew what had nothing to do with a peafowl. This is one of
the many cases where it seems as though Mrs. Sinclair had glimpses
ahead in a series.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the agent’s second drawing <em>was</em> a peacock (Fig. <a href='#fig_75'>75</a>). And
the percipient not only said “peafowl again,” which constitutes a
complete success, but she also drew what it seems likely are impressions
of the peacock’s long neck and of the “eyes” or spots of his
wings (Fig. <a href='#fig_75a'>75a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The agent’s third drawing was of an hourglass, with sand running
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>from its upper to its lower part (Fig. <a href='#fig_133'>133</a>). The resemblance
in shape of the percipient’s tree (Fig. <a href='#fig_133a'>133a</a>) to the upper half of the
hourglass is evident, its trunk may represent the slender line of
flowing sand, and “white” sand is placed relatively like the sand in
the lower part of the hourglass. The percipient’s results seem to be
partly from the lines of the original drawing, but also from Mr.
Sinclair’s thoughts about the sand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Sinclair’s fourth drawing represents an animal (dog?) running
after a ball attached to a string (Fig. <a href='#fig_9'>9</a>). Mrs. Sinclair’s drawing
shows (a) an animal, (b) also running, (c) in the same direction, (d)
having a short tail as in the original, (e) the tail represented by two
diverging lines, (f) a line extending from its nose, but touching the
nose, while there is a space between in the original, (g) the line
running left and at about the same angle from the horizontal. Besides
the script which appears in the cut (Fig. <a href='#fig_9a'>9a</a>) Mrs. Sinclair wrote
“Long thing like rope flung out in front of him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I should say that the addition of that “rope” drawn in front of
the animal at that angle made chance guessing of the combination
at least ten times as unlikely, and, on the basis of my hundreds of
experiments in guessing, I should not <em>expect</em> in ten thousand such
experiments on the basis of the same original drawing one reproduction
as good in the summation of its correspondences.</p>

<h4 class='c029'>Series of March 11, 1929</h4>

<p class='c019'>1. <em>Agt.</em>, a fountain which, were it taken alone, might be taken
for a tree, standing in what superficially appears like a long shallow
tub-like structure (Fig. <a href='#fig_53'>53</a>); <em>Per.</em>, a long, shallow tub, with two tree-like
objects above it and on its rim, (2) a drawing, the upper portion
of which parts in the center and leans to either side, as does the
fountain. The tree or plant-like objects are both said to “shine,”
which does not so well comport with a tree or plant as with a fountain
sparkling in the sunshine (Fig. <a href='#fig_53a'>53a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <em>Agt.</em>, a melon on an inclined plane, having a stem and leaf
on the stem; <em>Per.</em>, three drawings: (1) what suggests the leaf and
stem of the original twice over, (2) an unnameable figure, but slanting
like the original, (3) what looks like some kind of fruit with
stem, also slanting like the original.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <em>Agt.</em>, the figure 6 followed by the mark indicating <em>per cent</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>not single-line drawn but having breadth as if cut out of cardboard;
<em>Per.</em>, the letter F, a failure except for the curious parallel that this
also is formed as if made with strips of cardboard.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <em>Agt.</em>, a fishhook (Fig. <a href='#fig_78'>78</a>); <em>Per.</em>, (1) a figure very much like
the fishhook except that the barb is transformed into a tiny flower
(Fig. <a href='#fig_78a'>78a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <em>Agt.</em>, an obelisk (Fig. <a href='#fig_79'>79</a>); <em>Per.</em>, two drawings, the first of
which shows the three long lines of the obelisk but with a slight
curvature (Fig. <a href='#fig_79a'>79a</a>).<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c017'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>6. <em>Agt.</em>, as in Figure 80; <em>Per.</em>, as in Figure 80a. Only point of
resemblance the two angles formed by the legs of the reclining seat.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. <em>Agt.</em>, what was probably intended to represent a German
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Pickelhaube</span></i> (Fig. <a href='#fig_5'>5</a>); <em>Per.</em>, what the accompanying script called a
“Knight’s helmet”; very similar (Fig. <a href='#fig_5a'>5a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>8. <em>Agt.</em>, a row of five pillars (shown with a rather extraordinary
perspective slant), each mainly indicated by three or four vertical
parallel lines, an entablature above (Fig. <a href='#fig_132'>132</a>); <em>Per.</em>, four pillar-like
objects constructed of vertical parallel lines, three to five, the
presumed pillars having no entablature but in themselves and additional
lines showing the same slant as in the original. The presumed
pillars are likewise nearly equally spaced, but are of unequal
heights, indicating that the percipient’s impression was a visual one
and that she had no clear idea what she was drawing (Fig. <a href='#fig_132a'>132a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>9. <em>Agt.</em>, presumably a palm tree (Fig. <a href='#fig_8'>8</a>); <em>Per.</em>, two objects hard
to name, but each in a general way curiously like the original, even
to the bend in what is presumably the trunk, though it is not the
same bend (Fig. <a href='#fig_8a'>8a</a>).</p>

<h4 class='c029'>Series of March 16, 1929</h4>

<p class='c019'>There were seven tests on this date.</p>

<p class='c010'>1. <em>Agt.</em>, a burning lamp (Fig. <a href='#fig_40'>40</a>); <em>Per.</em>, as in Figure 40a,
whether the drawing represents a tube from which flame proceeds,
or the wick and that part of the lamp which is within the chimney,
at any rate the same lines which conventionally signify light appear
as in the original. Accompanying script says “flame and sparks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>2. <em>Agt.</em>, a butterfly net (Fig. <a href='#fig_110'>110</a>); <em>Per.</em>, the handle of the net
is duplicated, and the general shape of the net is pretty well shown
(Fig. <a href='#fig_110a'>110a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>3. <em>Agt.</em>, a carnation with four near-angles along its upper edge
(Fig. <a href='#fig_113'>113</a>); <em>Per.</em>, four triangles in a row with a hint of lines below
(Fig. <a href='#fig_113a'>113a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <em>Agt.</em>, a trench mortar (Fig. <a href='#fig_42'>42</a>); <em>Per.</em>, a figure considerably
like but shorter than the trench mortar, and likewise pointing
upward, a stem-like extension like the axle in the original but on
the other side, whiffs of smoke emerging (Fig. <a href='#fig_42a'>42a</a>). Here the impressions
received seem partly visual, partly ideational.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <em>Agt.</em>, a telegraph pole and four wires proceeding horizontally
from it in two directions (Fig. <a href='#fig_129'>129</a>); <em>Per.</em>, something like a
pole, and five lines proceeding from it in one direction (Fig. <a href='#fig_129a'>129a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <em>Agt.</em>, two hearts side by side, transfixed horizontally by an
arrow (Fig. <a href='#fig_126'>126</a>); <em>Per.</em>, two balloon-like shapes side by side, transfixed
horizontally by a line (Fig. <a href='#fig_126a'>126a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>7. <em>Agt.</em>, a frieze (Fig. <a href='#fig_124'>124</a>); <em>Per.</em>, what looks like a detail of a
different design yet one which also consists of parallel lines enclosing
narrow tracts which run in different directions (Fig. <a href='#fig_124a'>124a</a>).
Even so much of distant resemblance would not occur anything like
once in ten times by chance.</p>

<h4 class='c029'>Miscellaneous Examples</h4>

<p class='c019'>February 23, 1929. The agent drew a steamboat with incorrectly
designed stem paddle wheel (Fig. <a href='#fig_77'>77</a>). The percipient’s results
are very interesting (Figs. <a href='#fig_77a'>77a</a>, <a href='#fig_77b'>77b</a>, <a href='#fig_77c'>77c</a>). There is smoke, so
labeled, by itself, then the smoke stack with smoke issuing from it,
then the paddle wheel in the water, its paddles more correctly
placed externally to the rim, then what may mean smoke containing
cinders. The cut of the paddle wheel has left out the axle-end, very
distinctly indicated in the original pencil drawing.</p>

<p class='c010'>February 17, 1929. The agent drew an Alpine hat with a
feather (Fig. <a href='#fig_142'>142</a>). Of the shapes drawn by the percipient (Fig.
142a) the one on the right may very possibly be related to the rim
and the band of the hat, the top left one is very suggestive of the
feather, and the bottom one, though called in the script a “chafing
dish,” is very like the hat. All this suggests that the attention of the
agent was directed first to one part, then to another and another of
his drawing.</p>

<p class='c010'>February 29,<a id='t190'></a> 1929. The agent drew a very intricate and unusual
cross, one with eight arms, notched at the ends (see Figs. 7,
7a). The percipient also drew a circle of notched arms, but seven
in number. One would suppose that when she began she had no
idea where the drawing would end, or it would be more regular.</p>

<p class='c010'>Through all the experiments of the period covered by the book
<cite>Mental Radio</cite>, and enough more to make 300, there is no other
agent drawing resembling this. And nowhere is there another percipient
drawing like it. Granting that the percipient should make
such a drawing once, which was by no means certain (nothing like
it appears among the 564 Guess-drawings reported in this Bulletin),
then the chance of its coinciding in place with the eight-armed
cross of the agent would be 1 in 300.</p>

<p class='c010'>February 17, 1929. The agent drew an open umbrella, with
curved handle (Fig. <a href='#fig_122'>122</a>). The percipient wrote, “I feel that it is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>snake crawling out of something—vivid feeling of snake, but it looks
like a cat’s tail.” And in her drawing (Fig. <a href='#fig_122a'>122a</a>) we have the curved
umbrella handle, but it has sprouted a tongue and an eye; the
ellipse of the umbrella rim is retained but it is a smaller one; otherwise
the “something” is shaped wrongly.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have cited instances where Mrs. Sinclair proved that she
got an inkling of some drawing in a series before reaching it, by
writing down at the moment her conviction. In <cite>Mental Radio</cite> our
attention is called to a number of instances of seeming anticipations
even where Mrs. Sinclair was not so conscious of them, or at least
did not write down her expectation that some particular thing was
coming. Here is an instance not mentioned in the book. The next
agent’s drawing after the umbrella <em>was</em> a snake. Had it not been
for the dawning consciousness of <em>that</em> snake, the umbrella handle
might not have undergone metamorphosis.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c017'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>February ?, 1929. The agent made an American flag, with pole
surmounted by a ball (Fig. <a href='#fig_127'>127</a>). The percipient failed to get the
stars but she got the stripes and the pole, and the ball, which last
has wandered from its place, although the neighborhood in which
it should be is sensed (Fig. <a href='#fig_127a'>127a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>March ?, 1929. Mrs. Sinclair wrote “Muley cow with tongue
hanging out.” And this is the drawing her husband had made (Fig.
137). In 260 experiments in guessing, the originals being replicas
of Mr. Sinclair’s drawings on February 15, there was not one success.
We would have said that Mrs. Sinclair had a success in this
case had she merely said “Cow.” But she did better than this, for
she got the particular “tongue hanging out,” which certainly increases
the value tenfold. I venture to say that not one time in
twenty will a picture of a cow show her with her tongue hanging
out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pursuing the tests past the period until more than 300 have
been had, we find that Mr. Sinclair drew a cow’s head three times.
Once the percipient’s response was technically a failure; it resembled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>horns, or rather antlers. The second time she got a chicken’s
face, again strictly a failure, but at least something with animal life.
The third time was the “cow with tongue hanging out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And there were three other times that Mrs. Sinclair either drew
a cow’s head or wrote “cow” or “calf.” For the first see Figures 15,
15a. In the second instance the agent had drawn a face, not that of
a cow but of a man. The third was a brilliant success, not in name
but in form. The agent had drawn what was doubtless intended for
a donkey with a harness band across its neck. In the reproduction
the donkey’s long ears were metamorphosed to resemble horns,
and across the cow’s neck is a band, which the lady interpreted in
the following script: “Cow’s head in stock.”</p>

<p class='c010'>March 2, 1929. The agent drew six concentric circles (Fig.
144). As in the case of the balloon (see Figs. 95, 95a), the percipient
seemed to “see” only part of the original. She also draws concentric
circles, but omits about a quarter of each (Fig. <a href='#fig_144a'>144a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>We can allow space but for one more exhibit, and this because
of its seeming suggestiveness (Figs. <a href='#fig_56'>56</a>, <a href='#fig_56a'>56a</a>). Of course, when we
move away from correspondences in visual form or direct correspondences
in idea we enter a region where the possibilities of
chance relation are considerable. Nevertheless, literature abounds
in associations between fleeing foxes on the one hand and guns and
sounding horns on the other. It seems likely enough, therefore
(though I would not bring forward this case as <em>proof</em>), that the
sensing of the original drawing found a path for emergence through
association ideas.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are many more tests described and illustrated in Mr.
Sinclair’s book. What we have given has been, save for a few exceptions,
according to selected and entire groups or series on particular
dates.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>PERCIPIENT SEQUELAE TO CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF AGENT DRAWINGS</h3>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Sinclair remarks that “when in these drawing tests there
has been anything [that is, in his drawings] indicating fire or smoke
she has ‘got’ it, with only one or two failures out of more than a
dozen cases.” This would mean a much larger ratio of success for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>the drawings so characterized than that for the total number of
drawings. Mr. Sinclair accounts for this by the fact that his wife,
owing to terrifying incidents in her childhood, is exceedingly sensitive
to the thought of fire and given to taking unusual precautions.
Readers will probably agree that this is a plausible and sensible
theory. I propose to tabulate <em>all</em> such tests, including the original
drawings significant of light.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>
  <h4 class='c030'>Originals Representing Forms of Animal Life</h4>
</div>

<p class='c019'>In some cases, after the agent had drawn an animal, a bird, or
some other creature possessing animal life, the percipient’s drawing
was successful, partly successful or at least suggestive in shape; in
many instances it was a flat failure. But as examination proceeded
it began to appear that a number of the failures represented some
other form of the animal kingdom, however diverse. A careful
canvass was made, including the material in hand produced subsequent
to that in the Sinclair book, embracing in all 388 experiments;
drawings of human beings, animals, birds, fishes, insects,
and parts of bodies, as a hand or a leg, were included.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Agent drew 103 such out of 388.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Percipient drew 98 such out of 388.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were found to be 39 correspondences;<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c017'><sup>[22]</sup></a> that is, in 39
cases, where the agent drew some animal form or part thereof, the
percipient also drew some animal form or part thereof. If out of a
total of 388, the agent makes 103 drawings of this character, chance
would give about 26 correspondences, so defined, among the 98
reproductions. In fact, there are 39, another proof, by a peculiar
test, that something more than chance is in operation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now let us make another test, this time including the material
only up to the close of the period covered by the book, and not
insisting, as we have done above, on strict recognition of reproductions,
but stating precisely how they compare with the originals in
form.</p>

<h4 class='c030'>Originals Representing the Sun</h4>

<p class='c019'>In the course of 300 experiments, extending a little beyond the
period reported by the book, there were but two of these.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first was on February 11, 1929. The agent made a sun as
children draw it, a circle with rays surrounding it. The percipient
made no drawing but wrote “Setting sun and bird in the sky. Big
bird on the wing—sea gull or wild goose.” Mr. Sinclair calls this a
partial success, and surely it is.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second was on February 15, more than fifty experiments
having intervened. The agent drew a sun over hills, the percipient
a circle with rays around it actually labelled “a sun,” over a “body.”
(See Figs. 93, 93a.) This also was a partial success.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus both times out of 300 experiments when Mr. Sinclair
made a sun, his wife “got it” and drew one also.</p>

<p class='c010'>But twice, also, Mrs. Sinclair drew what was meant for the
upper half of a sun at the horizon when there was no sun in the
original. In one of these instances the original did have something,
not a sun, considerably like the reproduction, and there was a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>degree of resemblance in the other. But let these count as
failures. We will allow the reader to figure out the chances of two
of Mrs. Sinclair’s four suns, in the course of 300 experiments, being
drawn at the same time when Mr. Sinclair drew his two suns.</p>

<h4 class='c030'>“Line-and-Circle-Men” Originals</h4>

<p class='c019'>On February 6, 1929, Mr. Sinclair made a line-and-circle man;
that is, one drawn in schoolboy fashion (Fig. <a href='#fig_106'>106</a>). The percipient
got the head circle, adding dots for features, and her crossing lines,
properly placed below the circle, roughly represent the spread of
arms and legs (Fig. <a href='#fig_106a'>106a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>On February 10th, thirty experiments having intervened, the
agent made two such men, facing each other in boxing attitudes
(Fig. <a href='#fig_107'>107</a>). It will be seen that just two vertical lines, longer than
any of the others, enter into their composition. The longest lines
in what the percipient drew are also two and vertical. And she got
a confused notion of the legs and arms, each with its angle for knee
or elbow. She failed to get any circles (Fig. <a href='#fig_107a'>107a</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>All through the period covered by the book, and past it until
the 300th experiment, there is no other line-and-circle man original.
The percipient in the same number of experiments made one
drawing in which head and body are represented by a circle and an
ellipse, and the rest of the man by single lines. And she made one
fairly well drawn head with hair, the rest of the figure represented
by single lines.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>A STUDY IN “ANTICIPATIONS”</h3>

<h4 class='c029'>Series of February 11, 1929</h4>

<p class='c019'>We have been pursuing the rigorous rule of estimating a percipient
drawing by its correspondence or lack of correspondence
with the agent drawing then in hand. Only when Mrs. Sinclair
announced in advance that a described drawing would come in a
series, and it actually came, have we given weight to an anticipation.
Such an instance was that of the snow and sled drawing of
February 8th. This is not by any means to say that other “anticipations”
have not had weight, as a matter of fact. In some of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>instances exhibited in <cite>Mental Radio</cite> the original drawings represented
objects of such character that it was extremely unlikely that
there should be a near correspondence among the half dozen or
dozen reproductions constituting the whole series, or in fifty guesses.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again, there could be a series with so many of these correspondences
out of order that one is mathematically<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c017'><sup>[24]</sup></a> and logically
compelled to acknowledge that there was anticipation. Such a series
is that of February 11, 1929.</p>

<p class='c010'>1. <em>Agt.</em>, a molar tooth; <em>Per.</em>, an ellipse containing 19 tiny circles.
This is emphatically a failure compared with the contemporaneous
original drawing. However, see No. 12. Before the drawing
was made, the percipient wrote “First see rooster. Then elephant.”</p>

<p class='c010'>2. And now <em>Agt.’s</em> drawing <em>was</em> an elephant, as far back as but
lacking hind legs. And <em>Per.</em> wrote “Elephant comes again. I try to
suppress it, and see lines, and a spike sticking some way into something.”
And she draws two vertical lines, related to each other in
ribbon fashion, what looks like a pin with circle for head, crossing
the band through a slit indicated by two short vertical lines, and
below the “spike” two widely separated vertical lines. The “spike”
crosses what I have called a ribbon exactly as the elephant’s tusk
crosses his trunk, the round eye of the elephant has moved slightly
to form the head of the “spike,” and the vertical lines below may
stand for a feeling that <em>something</em> (really the front legs) should be
below. We have some warrant for our interpretation from the
words “Elephant comes again. I try to suppress it.” Had she not
tried to suppress it (because of the erroneous notion that it is but a
memory of the elephant impression of Experiment 1), it is fair to
assume that she would have tried to draw an elephant. She “tried
to suppress” the animal, but his eye and “spike,” which was really
“sticking into something,” but not in the manner drawn, seem to
have persisted. (See Figs. 66, 66a.)</p>

<p class='c010'>3. And now <em>Agt.</em> <em>did</em> draw a rooster. Both elephant and
rooster, with which she was impressed at Experiment 1, had come
by the time Experiment 3 had been reached. This is rather too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>much for “chance coincidence,” especially as the Sinclairs do not
have an elephant among their domestic pets. But this is not all.
As <em>Per.</em> not only announced an elephant in advance but got details
of the elephant when that animal actually was in hand as the original,
so not only was a rooster announced in advance but when the
original is a rooster, <em>Per.</em> gets correspondences. She writes “I don’t
know what, see a bunch, or tuft clearly. Also a crooked arm on a
body. But don’t feel that I’m right.” What she drew was remarkably
like the rear three-quarters of the rooster, the “tuft” representing
its tail, “the crooked arm” its two legs in conjunction. (See
Figs. 67, 67a.)</p>

<p class='c010'>4. <em>Agt.</em>, a table; <em>Per.</em>, “Flower. This is a very vivid one.
Green-spine-leaves like century plant,” and a corresponding drawing
with tall flowering spike in the center. (See Fig. <a href='#fig_68a'>68a</a>.) A flat
failure, but wait for Experiments 7 and 11.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. <em>Agt.</em>, a fishhook; <em>Per.</em>, no drawing but script: “Dog wagging
tail—see tail in air busy wagging—jolly doggie—tail curled in
the air.” Well, a fishhook <em>is</em> somewhat like a tail curled in the air.
But script followed: “Now I see a cow. I fear the elephant and
chicken got me too sure of animals. But I see these.” A tail curled
in the air—a dog or a cow! Wait for No. 7.</p>

<p class='c010'>6. <em>Agt.</em>, a sun represented by a large circle surrounded by
rays; <em>Per.</em>, “Setting sun and bird in the sky. Big bird on wing—sea
gull or wild goose.” Obviously this is a partial success.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. <em>Agt.</em>, what was intended for the rear half of a cow, with tail
curled almost exactly like a fishhook. Remember that in No. 5 <em>Per.</em>
had an impression of a dog with “tail curled in the air” and a later
impression of a cow. As a matter of fact, Mr. Sinclair’s cow does
not have a cow’s tail but one made in the fashion of a hound’s tail.
<em>Per.</em> in this No. 7 experiment makes a drawing like that of No. 4,
except that the central spike is not so long, and writes “This is a
<em>real</em> flower. I’ve seen it before. It’s vivid and returns. Century
plant. Now it turns into a candlestick. See a candle.” And she
drew what she probably meant for a five-armed candlestick, with
one candle in the center. But it is much like the plant called “cat-tail,”
except that the leaves diverge too widely. (See Fig. <a href='#fig_69a'>69a</a>.)</p>

<p class='c010'>8. <em>Agt.</em>, a long line with seven short evenly-spaced lines running
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>from it at right angles—probably meant for a rake-head; <em>Per.</em>,
what is probably intended for two sticks of wood, fire proceeding
from one of them, and smoke above. Script: “Fire and smoke—flame.”
Also, “Must be campfire as I now see an Indian warrior
near it in a war dress—feathered headpiece, etc.” There is a certain
amount of resemblance between the rake-head and the stick of
wood with the more or less straight lines springing from one side of
it. (See Fig. <a href='#fig_43a'>43a</a>.) And one remembers that an Indian headdress,
of the type which hangs down the back, consists of feathers on one
side and directed outwardly from the band to which they are attached.
But these are only suggested possibilities of connection,
and are doubtful. There is even another possible connection, for
it may be that “Fire and smoke” was influenced by the cannon of
the following original.</p>

<p class='c010'>9. <em>Agt.</em>, the forward part of an old-style cannon, a double-line
ellipse marking its mouth seen in perspective; <em>Per.</em>, the half of a
double-line ellipse with a curving tangle as of smoke, labeled
“Fire,” and outside the script: “Half circle, double lines—light
inside—light is fire busy whirling or flaming.” Partly right and
very suggestive. (See Fig. <a href='#fig_44a'>44a</a>.)</p>

<p class='c010'>10. <em>Agt.</em>, three concentric triangles; <em>Per.</em>, two wheels and over
them the suggestion of some vehicle-body—only a line and two
angles. Failure.</p>

<p class='c010'>11. <em>Agt.</em>, a “cat-tail,” its leaves by no means correctly drawn,
but there is no doubt of its identity; <em>Per.</em>, a drawing doubtfully
marked “Dog’s head,” its ears, if such they are, also its muzzle, long
and pointed, much resembling the upper halves of Mr. Sinclair’s
cat-tail leaves. But remember Mrs. Sinclair’s “century plant” of
No. 2 with its somewhat similar leaves and its central spike; remember
especially the “candlestick” of No. 7, which so much resembles
a cat-tail. (See Figs. 69a, 70, 70a.)</p>

<p class='c010'>12. <em>Agt.</em>, ten small circles arranged in rows, pyramidal fashion;
<em>Per.</em> wrote only “Nothing except all the preceding ones come—too
many at once—all past ones crowding in memory.” I wish she
had stated which past one, if any, crowded most, and which came
first. For it happens that her drawing for No. 2, so different from
the impressions “a rooster” and “an elephant,” set down at the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>time, also consisted of little circles, also in rows, but more in number
and enclosed within an elliptical line.</p>

<p class='c010'>13. <em>Agt.</em>, a drinking-glass with double elliptic line at the top
and small ellipse indicating the bottom; <em>Per.</em>, double elliptic line
above, same below with indefinite lines rising from the latter. The
script is more significant: “Think of a saucer, then of a cup. It’s
something in the kitchen. Too tired to see.” Pretty close. (See
Figs. 72, 72a.)</p>

<p class='c010'>The occurrence of so many correspondences, direct and oblique,
among thirteen consecutive experiments constituting the
entire series performed at one time, and these by mere accidental
coincidence, is practically unthinkable.</p>

<h4 class='c029'>Later Experiments by Professor William McDougall</h4>

<p class='c019'>In the main, this review has dealt only with the period covered
by <cite>Mental Radio</cite>, although it has exhibited some experiments not
illustrated or even mentioned therein. A few of the special tabulations
have also included a part or all of the later tests made by Mr.
and Mrs. Sinclair, to the number of more than a hundred, the materials
of which are in my hands. When the tabulations have reached
so far, the fact has been stated.</p>

<p class='c010'>But it may be well to say something about tests made by Professor
William McDougall during a sojourn in California, July-August,
1930. He examined the proofs of previous work and
consented to write an introduction to <cite>Mental Radio</cite>, saying: “A
refusal would imply on my part a lack either of courage or of due
sense of scientific responsibility.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* It is the duty of men of
science to give whatever encouragement and sympathetic support
may be possible to all amateurs who find themselves in a position
to observe and carefully and honestly to study such phenomena.
Mrs. Sinclair would seem to be one of the rare persons who have
telepathic power in a marked degree and perhaps other supernormal
powers. The experiments in telepathy, as reported in the pages
of this book, were so remarkably successful as to rank among the
very best hitherto reported. The degree of success and the conditions
of experiment were such that we can reject them as conclusive
evidence of some mode of communication not at present explicable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>in accepted scientific terms only by assuming that Mr. and Mrs.
Sinclair either are grossly stupid, incompetent and careless persons,
or have deliberately entered upon a conspiracy to deceive the public
in a most heartless and reprehensible fashion.” As we have seen,
the circle of conspirators would have to be enlarged to admit Mr.
and Mrs. Irwin, for they vouched for an extraordinarily successful
series of experiments at long distance. And it would have to be
enlarged to include Professor McDougall himself, since he sent me
the materials of his experiments, whose results, though inferior to
many of the series of 1928 and 1929, yet show a ratio and quality of
correspondence vastly beyond chance expectation. Remember that
the 260 Guessing tests resulted in not one drawing which, being
compared with the original, could possibly be regarded as a Success,
and this by the independent verdicts of two judges. Of course,
this does not mean that another set of 260 guesses would not show
one Success or more than one, but it does show the great improbability
that a particular drawing made by guess will correspond with
the particular original enough so that it is possible to call it a
Success. The 260 guess-drawings, according to one of the judges,
showed 3 Partial Successes, 1 according to the other. Then say
there was no Success and but 3 Partial Successes, and it is still unlikely
that a particular drawing made in any short guess series will
correspond with the particular original to the extent of being
worthy of the title Success or Partial Success. On the basis of those
260 guesses we would be warranted in assuming that there would
be about one-third of a likelihood of getting either a Success or a
Partial Success in a series of 25. But another series of 260 guesses
might be more fortunate, so call it an expectation of getting one.
Professor McDougall had 25 experiments with Mrs. Sinclair.</p>

<p class='c010'>On July 19th, “five cards drawn or chosen and sealed in envelope
and thick paper at Santa Monica and presented in turn
sealed to Mrs. S. at Long Beach.” Reproductions 1, 3 and 4 were
failures. But agent’s No. 2 was a “prairie schooner” showing two
wheels with spokes and a long black line crossing the wheels at their
hubs and standing for both the bottom of the vehicle-body and the
shafts in front, while the percipient drew (1) a wheel with spokes
and a long black line running from the hub, and (2) a wheel-like
shape without spokes, but the line extending far in one direction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>and passing through the hub and beyond the wheel a short way in
the other direction, as in the original. Here we have a distinct
Partial Success. Agent’s No. 5 was a postal-card picture of a part
of Oxford, the most conspicuous feature in which is the tower of
Magdalen College with pinnacles and high, narrow windows. The
percipient made a drawing which anyone would recognize as a
tower, with bristling short lines projecting upward from the top
suggesting pinnacles, and high, narrow windows. The proportions
of height and width are approximately correct. Below the lower
window level are two parallel horizontal lines, which call attention
to such lines in the original. This was drawn, however, while the
percipient was holding agent’s No. 4, his No. 5, the tower, still
being in his pocket. It looks like an anticipation. But when she
arrived at No. 5 she wrote “Turret of a castle and trees,” and now
she is right for the very original in hand, which does display, besides
a river, a bridge and buildings, the conspicuous tower, and
trees prominent in the picture. She added “Sword,” “Scissors,” and
“Key,” which may possibly be erroneous impressions from the pinnacles.
So we have here a striking result, worthy to be called a Success.
I have again taken pains to go through all the originals and
all the reproductions, 413 of each, and find that but once besides
did an original represent a tower. It was the Eiffel Tower, and all
will remember its tall, slender and tapering shape. The percipient’s
drawing represented a long, slender and tapering cone—a Partial
Success. And but once besides, among all 413 drawings, did the
percipient present a tower. This was on the following August 16th,
when, apparently as an experiment, the drawings were “done in a
hurry” and no record made of the order. If compared with a particular
one of the originals, the “tower top” is a Partial Success,
but it probably was a Failure. So here we have the factors: out of
418 agent drawings two represent towers, and one results in a percipient
Success, the other in a Partial Success; out of 418 percipient
drawings two represent towers, and one is a Success, the other a
Failure.</p>

<p class='c010'>On July 20th Professor McDougall made 5 drawings “at one
end of a long room, while Mrs. Sinclair tried to reproduce them
at the other end.” The agent made what is supposed to be a stork,
each foot furnished with three toes. The percipient made two long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>legs with three-toed feet, the legs extending from a curved line like
the under side of a bird. Above and isolated is what looks like a
crest, which the stork does not have. Partial Success. The 4th agent
drawing is of a ringed target and a feathered arrow sticking in it,
the barb not visible. The percipient drawing is practically the
feathered part of the shaft. Partial Success. The 5th agent drawing
shows a drum-like object with elliptical top, from the center of
which a tube or spout projects vertically, with water rising from
the spout, parting and falling to right and to left so that it looks
something like a tree. The percipient drew (1) an ellipse, (2) an
ellipse, (3) something like a very round teapot, with elliptic top
and spout at an angle of 45 degrees, (4) something like the vertical
trunk of a tree surmounted by a ball of foliage. Success; there are
too many suggestive partial parallels to allow this to be doubted.</p>

<p class='c010'>July 26th there were 5 experiments, all drawn by Professor
McDougall except one, that being a postal-card picture of trees,
bushes and the yucca in bloom. Agent’s No. 2 was a wheel with
spokes and tire nicely drawn. Percipient made three circles in a
row with something like the connecting rod of a locomotive across
them. This is at least Suggestive. Directly before the yucca picture,
the percipient described plants with flowers, but the description
did not fit the original next to come, nor did the impression of
flowers persist when the yucca was at hand, so I do not allow this
to count at all. There were no other successes in any degree.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then followed experiments, one a day, with Professor McDougall
drawing at Santa Monica, Mrs. Sinclair drawing at the
same time at Pasadena, thirty miles distant.</p>

<p class='c010'>July 30th. A failure.</p>

<p class='c010'>August 2nd. Original drawing: a coffee-pot, its spout at the
right of peculiar shape, somewhat like the profile of a boat’s stern.
The percipient’s drawing was principally made up of a vertical line
like the edge of the coffee-pot, and turned to the right from its
upper extremity a projection curiously like the coffee-pot’s spout.
To the left of the vertical line seven dots. It may be a mere coincidence
that in the original there are several, but not seven, dark
spots in the drawing, placed relatively about as far from the right
edge of the coffee-pot as the dots are from the vertical line in the
percipient drawing. The drawing is Suggestive, at least.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>August 10th. Original drawing a teapot, and percipient’s
drawing, a palm frond, was relatively to it, a failure.</p>

<p class='c010'>August 11th. Agent drew a faucet. Percipient wrote “Teapot,”
which is a failure. But agent had drawn a teapot the previous
day—did percipient get a deferred telepathic impression?</p>

<p class='c010'>August 13th. Agent drew a palm tree and percipient’s result
was a failure. But, records agent, “Had it in mind to draw the palm
in patio several days before. Mrs. S. seemed to get it August 10th.”
No agent should have in mind to draw one thing when he actually
draws another. If the result is from telepathy, not clairvoyance, a
percipient is at least as likely to get that on which the agent’s mind
has dwelt. On the whole it would perhaps be fair to count this as
a Success.</p>

<p class='c010'>August 16th. Agent drew a flower-pot and in it a plant with
sword-shaped leaves, somewhat like a century plant. Percipient
first drew what one might take to be a stalk with five straight, short
leafless branches, but with the script “Velvet bow with band.” She
added, “Then saw” and drew a plant—no pot—with leaves exactly
of the form of the leaves in the original, and added, “I have too
many leaves in the above.” Right: she had 11 leaves, the original
had 7. This certainly is at least a Partial Success.</p>

<p class='c010'>August 17th, August 18th and August 19th each yielded a
Failure.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now let us take account of stock. On the basis of our 260
experiments in guessing we would have about one-third of an
expectation of finding in the McDougall experiments one Partial
Success, but as another series of 260 guesses might be more fortunate
we proposed to reckon a full likelihood of getting one Success
or Partial Success, on the theory that Mrs. Sinclair was guessing
also. But we have found 3 Successes and 4 Partial Successes (not
counting a possible “anticipation,” and 2 instances of Suggestive).
It is not mathematics, it is not logic, it is not common-sense to conclude
that we have not, even in this series of Professor McDougall,
although it does not equal some which have been exhibited, something
for which chance is wholly unable to account.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not at all difficult to account for the fact that Professor
McDougall’s results were not quite up to the average of Mrs. Sinclair’s
work during the period covered by <cite>Mental Radio</cite>, both quantity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>and quality taken into consideration. In the first place, it has
for many years been evident that something depends upon the degree
of <em>rapport</em> between agent and percipient; in other words, that
some persons are better suited than others to act as agents in relation
to a particular percipient. Thus, we are told in the book (pages
<a href='#Page_33'>33</a>–34) that among the friends of Mrs. Sinclair there was one peculiarly
adapted in this respect—Mrs. Kate Crane-Gartz. I venture to
relate my own very limited experience, as fact, not scientifically
guaranteed. I have had reason to suppose that I was getting telepathic
messages only with two persons. One was with my wife the
first time I ever experimented with her, and then I got most of the
objects she was thinking of, more or less satisfactorily, in about
eight trials. But I never again had <em>any</em> measurable success with her,
though I tried repeatedly. The other person I was for a time in
sympathetic relations with, and there occurred a number of incidents
which convinced me that I was acting as a spontaneous percipient.
The most striking category of these is the same which Mr.
Sinclair describes when he says: “My wife will say to me, ‘Mrs.
Gartz is going to phone,’ and in a minute or two the phone will
ring.” Repeatedly, when I had no particular reason to think that
the lady to whom I refer would ‘phone me, and when I was occupied
with work, I would suddenly, as by a jerk, look at the ‘phone,
expecting it to ring, and in a few moments it would do so. I have
even gone to the ‘phone, almost without thinking, and stood there
for half a minute or so before it did so. This period lasted for perhaps
three or four months only, then faded out. Never at any other
time, nor with any other person, not even with my daughter between
whom and me there is the most cordial sympathy, has there
been evidence of this kind sufficiently striking and repetitious to
arrest serious attention. So it may well be that Professor McDougall,
however amiable and fairminded he is, not having been long
known to the percipient and being invested with the awe of a psychologist
of extended reputation, was not so well adapted to be an
agent in relation to her as her husband or her brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c010'>But again, while at times Mrs. Sinclair to the last of her experimentation
analyzed by me got excellent results, I find that, whether
because she was wearied, or too much occupied by other things, or
more anxious and less spontaneous, or for whatever reason, did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>in the later months do so well on the average as during the earlier
months. The poorest stretch of the period after the material covered
by the book was that from August 1 to August 28, 1929, inclusive.
There were 27 experiments, of which, according to my reckoning,
2 were Successes, 1 a Partial Success, 3 Suggestive, 2 Slightly
Suggestive and 19 Failures in a series of 27 experiments. The poorest
stretch of experiments during the book period was that ending
with the series of February 17, 1929, nevertheless shown on account
of its significance. Here there were 4 Successes, 8 Partial Successes,
4 Suggestive, 1 Slightly Suggestive and 10 Failures out of the same
total number of 27. So, after all, while the McDougall results did
not reach the highest level of the later period, they did not by any
means mark the lowest level. They greatly transcend the expectation
of chance, and, with the exception of five experiments only,
were achieved when agent and percipient were either thirty miles
apart or at the two ends of a long room.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>Attempts to Explain Otherwise Than by Telepathy</h3>

<h4 class='c029'>Would Chance Coincidence Explain?</h4>

<p class='c019'>It has already been proved by experiments in guessing that
even the comparatively poor Dessoir results were far beyond the
reach of chance. And it has been shown by experiments in guessing
that the Sinclair results were much farther beyond the reach of
chance. Such counter-tests may be repeated by any reader <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
libitum</span></i>.</p>

<h4 class='c029'>Would the Kindred Ideas of Relatives Explain?</h4>

<p class='c019'>It makes one feel foolish to add anything more about the curious
“thob” to the effect that what is taken for telepathy between
husbands and wives is really coincidence brought about by their
community of thought and tendency to think about the same
things. It should be evident that even if a husband and wife knew
only one hundred objects in common, that astonishing fact of limitation
would not imply that the lady would be likely to think of
a particular one of these, say No. 92, at the particular time that her
spouse chose it. For once it may be well to show just how narrow
and connubial a range of drawings a husband may submit to his
wife. (See Appendix II.)</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>
  <h4 class='c029'>Would Conscious or Subconscious Fraud on the Part of the Percipient Explain?</h4>
</div>

<p class='c019'>We must squarely face every possible theory, and this is one.
Mr. Sinclair himself dealt with it. We must do so more thoroughly,
in spite of Mrs. Sinclair’s testimony to remarkable telepathic experiences
in her earlier years (<cite>Mental Radio</cite>, p. <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>), in spite of her
husband’s testimony about her actually setting down in writing
what “Jan” was doing at a distance before she got from him the
substantially corresponding facts (pp. <a href='#Page_21'>21</a>–24), and getting in dreams
or by “concentration” facts concerning himself at a distance (pp.
<a href='#Page_31'>31</a>–33), in spite of Mrs. Sinclair’s reputation for practicality and
non-credulity (pp. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>, <a href='#Page_139'>139</a>), honor and conscientiousness (p. <a href='#Page_53'>53</a>), her
impressing her husband as being “a fanatic for accuracy” (pp. <a href='#Page_138'>138</a>–139),
the grave reasons which caused her to institute these experiments
(p. <a href='#Page_18'>18</a>; Appendix I), her intense desire to be sure, and to
satisfy every misgiving of her own (pp. <a href='#Page_136'>136</a>–137), her urgency that
her husband should watch her work (p. <a href='#Page_53'>53</a>), her variations in the
methods of experimentation to see what effect they would have
(pp. <a href='#Page_80'>80</a>, <a href='#Page_136'>136</a>–137, <a href='#Page_144'>144</a>), her reluctance that her husband should publish
his book until still more experiments were had (p. <a href='#Page_137'>137</a>), and
the great pains she takes to describe her method of development
and “preparation” in order to encourage others to experiment (pp.
<a href='#Page_116'>116</a>, <a href='#Page_128'>128</a>). All these considerations are cumulatively almost overwhelming,
yet we proceed in disregard of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the 7 experiments with “Bob” were at long distance, and
the conditions guaranteed by “Bob” and his wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 7 experiments of July 24–29, 1928, were conducted with
the agent in one room and the percipient in another, thirty feet
away, with a closed door between. That is to say, Mr. Sinclair, in
one room, would call out “All right” when ready to draw, his wife,
lying in another room, would call “All right” when she had completed
her drawing, and then the two drawings were compared.
He declares that there was no possible way by which Mrs. Sinclair
could have seen his drawing. So that any charge of fraud would
have to include him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 9 experiments of February 17, 1929, were thus conducted.
The original drawings were made by the agent, Mr. Sinclair, while
alone in his study, on green paper, enclosed in a sheet of green
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>paper, the whole folded, making four thicknesses absolutely impervious
to sight (as established in the office of the B.S.P.R.), put in
an envelope, the envelope sealed, and the 9 envelopes put on a
table by the percipient’s couch. She took each in turn and placed
it over her solar plexus, kept it there until her decision was made,
then sat up and made her drawing. All the while her husband sat
near, but absolutely speechless until her drawing was done, when
the wrappings were taken from the original drawing and it was
immediately compared with the reproduction. If the experiments
were at night, the reading light immediately over the percipient’s
head was extinguished, since she found that somewhat subdued
illumination favored passivity, but there remained sufficient light
in the room for comparison of the drawings, and every movement
of the woman was distinctly visible. If in the daytime, the window
shades back of the couch were lowered, but again every object was
distinctly visible. Under precisely these conditions, step by step, no
professional magician could have obtained knowledge of the original
drawing before making his own.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c017'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>As we have seen, 9 of Professor McDougall’s experiments, later
than the period of the book and reaching results defying the doctrine
of chance, were made with thirty miles between the parties,
and 10 of them with the parties at opposite ends of a long room.
Five more were done with McDougall at least watching his sealed
envelopes. It will probably not be suggested that he was in a conspiracy
to deceive the public, but in these cases fraud could hardly
have been practiced by the percipient alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Already we have 47 experiments, 16 with an intervening distance
of above thirty miles, 7 with agent and percipient in different
rooms, and 10 with agent and percipient at the two ends of a room;
14 with agent near the percipient but closely watching her and his
sealed opaque envelopes.</p>

<p class='c010'>But since Mr. Sinclair says that “several score drawings” were
drawn in his study, sealed in envelopes made impervious to sight,
and watched by him as one by one his wife laid them on her body
and set down her impressions, the total number of experiments,
guarded to this or a greater extent, aside from the later ones by
McDougall, could hardly have fallen short of 120.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Later, since Mr. Sinclair was very busy writing his novel “Boston”
and disliked the interruptions, he ceased (about midway of the
whole lot, he tells us) to enclose his drawings in envelopes and to
watch his wife’s work. Had this been the case throughout, any
report based on such “experiments” would not, scientifically speaking,
be worth the paper it was written on. As it is, I should be quite
willing to rest the whole case on the 120 or more guarded experiments
covered by the last two paragraphs. More than that, I would
be willing to rest it upon the 33 experiments conducted with the
participants separated by the length of a room, thirty feet and a
closed door, or thirty miles.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the logic of the situation is entirely against the assumption
that fraud was used any more after it became easily possible than
before, when it would have been possible only by the connivance
of various conspirators. Let us see.</p>

<p class='c010'>1. If advantage were to be taken of the relaxation of precautions
it would plainly be but for one purpose, to increase the number
or the excellence of favorable results, or both. But neither the
number nor the excellence of favorable results was enhanced. On
the contrary, not at once, but by a general though irregular decline,
the results deteriorated. The last 120 experiments of the period
covered by the book brought about half again as many complete
Failures as the first 120 had done. Mr. Sinclair reminds us that
“Series No. 6 which was carefully sealed up, produced 4 complete
Successes, 5 Partial Successes, and no Failures; whereas Series 21,
which was not put in envelopes at all, produced no complete Successes,
3 Partial Successes, and 6 Failures.” The declension, which
has been noted in experiments with other persons, continued, in
irregular fashion, after the period of the book. We have already
noted that the worst consecutive run of 27 experiments during that
last period yielded 19 Failures, while the worst consecutive run of
experiments during the period of the book yielded but 10 Failures.
Nor is there ever again, after precautions were relaxed, a single
consecutive run of seven experiments with quite such astounding
results as those of the first seven experiments of all, with “Bob,” at
some thirty miles distance in an air-line. Hence the percipient took
no advantage of the relaxation of conditions, or she did so to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>her work poorer on the average than it had been, which is against
human nature and practically inconceivable.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. It was almost silly to go further after fixing the fact that the
opening up of opportunities for improving results by clandestine
means was followed not by improvement but deterioration of results.
But an examination was made to see whether the drawings
underwent any modification such as would rather be expected from
the introduction of a new causative factor. None; they continued
to express in seemingly the same proportions, some the shape, some
the idea. Still in many cases they were unrecognizable as any
namable object, yet when compared with the original, showed more
or less of its marked characteristics.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. We even went so far as to compare the most of the later
drawings with what could be seen of them folded and in envelopes,
but unenclosed in opaque paper, when held up to the light. To be
sure, Mrs. Sinclair had been accustomed to subdue the light, to lie
with closed eyes in such a position that only the ceiling would have
been visible had they been open, and to hold the envelope, or after
the envelope itself was discarded, the paper in her hand lying on
her solar plexus, all of which is an arrangement ill-adapted to
“peeking.” And, to be sure, Mr. Sinclair would have been considerably
surprised had he come in and found a different situation.
But our experiments were meant to test whether, on the supposition
that she did alter her procedure, her drawings were such as
would have been explained by what was seen, even accidentally,
through the folded paper held up to the light. Certainly, in that
case, there would have been signs of the selection of heavy lines
which showed through clearly, and some evidence of the effects
from the paper being doubled. The result of the tests was negative.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is concluded, mainly on the basis of Section 1 above, but
assisted by Sections 2 and 3 were assistance necessary, that Mrs. Sinclair
was as honest when unwatched as when watched, since, had
fraud been used, it would have left traces. But, let me reiterate, I
am favorable to any proposition to take into account only the
guarded experiments, or even those guarded to an extent beyond
cavil.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>
  <h4 class='c029'>Would Involuntary Whispering Explain?</h4>
</div>

<p class='c019'>F. C. C. Hansen and Alfred Lehmann, Danish psychologists,
in 1895 published a pamphlet of 60 pages entitled <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Über Unwillkürliches
Flüstern</span></cite> (<cite>On Involuntary Whispering</cite>). This brochure
reported experiments by the authors which, they claimed, showed
that the apparent success in telepathic transmissions of numbers
achieved under the control of representatives of the S. P. R. and
published in its <em>Proceedings</em> (Vols. VI and VIII) might not have
been due to telepathy, but to involuntary whispering with closed
lips. Messrs. Hansen and Lehmann sat between concave spherical
mirrors so that the concentration of sound, their heads occupying
the foci, would presumably be an equivalent for the hyperaesthesia
of a <em>hypnotized</em> “percipient.” Each in turn acted as agent, to see if
figures could be conveyed by “involuntary whispering,” and
seemed to have a large degree of success. How it is possible to test
whether audible whispering can be produced with closed lips and
do so without the exercise of volition is something of a mystery.
And how they could be certain that some factor of telepathy did
not enter into their own experiments is not clear.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c017'><sup>[26]</sup></a> But Professor
Sidgwick, who five years before Hansen and Lehmann’s pamphlet
had considered and discussed the possibility of “unconscious whispering,”<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c017'><sup>[27]</sup></a>
later instituted experiments of his own and concluded
that something in this direction was possible. But he, William
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>James and others thoroughly riddled the Hansen and Lehmann
dream that perhaps they had explained the published S. P. R. series
of experiments for the transfer of numbers. For one thing, a part
of the experiments had been with the parties in different rooms.
And the notion that when the voluntarily involuntary whisper<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c017'><sup>[28]</sup></a> of
a digit was misheard, a digit whose name somewhat resembled was
most likely to be selected by the agent, was riddled too, so far as it
applied to the English experiments. The Danish gentlemen had
never claimed that their explanatory theory was proved, but only
that it was probable. Later they quite frankly acknowledged that
the Sidgwick and James “experiments and computations” had
weakened even its probability.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since their pamphlet had attracted much and widespread interest,
as it deserved to do, and since if they could establish or even
strengthen the probability of their theory it would mean a restoration
and enhancement of their prestige, set back by the counter-strokes
of Sidgwick, James, Schiller and others, it would seem that
the inducement not to stop short, but to go on with the experimentation
would be almost irresistible. But they either did stop there
or their results were disappointing, for nothing more, so far as I can
learn, was ever heard from them on this subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nevertheless, the possibility, especially on the part of a hyperaesthetic
percipient, of catching, to some extent, the sound of unintended
whispering by the agent stationed nearby, especially where
there is no guarantee that his lips are always closed, must be admitted.
This possibility has impressed some investigators, and especially
Herr Richard Baerwald, even beyond all logical grounds.
The named writer has said <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">also fort mit den Nahversuchen</span></i> (so away
with near-experimentation)! I certainly agree that experiments for
telepathy should be made with sufficient space between agent and
percipient to make the suggestion that there may have been some
perception of involuntary whispering manifestly incredible and
absurd. Such was Mrs. Sinclair’s success under such conditions as
to make it probable that if there had been many scores of experiments
under the same conditions a like staggering ratio of success
would have been maintained. Nevertheless, I must maintain that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>the involuntary whispering theory fails to touch many of the Sinclair
experiments attended with one or another degree of success,
considering their nature and the peculiar character of the percipient
drawings.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the first place, let me observe that where the experiments
were to transfer numbers the range of choice on the part of the
percipient, endeavoring to interpret any faintly heard indications
by the posited involuntary whispering, was strictly limited. If the
agent were to choose a figure from one to naught inclusive, the
percipient’s range for guessing would be but ten digits. If the agent
was to choose some figure from one to ninety-nine inclusive, the
range for guessing would of course be greater, yet more limited
than at first appears to be the case. There would be the ten digits,
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, twenty, thirty, forty,
fifty, and in addition only combinations from among the foregoing
or made up of a digit with “teen” or “ty” added. But where the
agent drew whatever he pleased, generally an object, his range was
unlimited, and the task of the percipient interpreting any indications
by involuntary whispering would be much more difficult.
But still it would be theoretically possible. So we turn to the next
and overwhelming point.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whenever the agent’s drawing was one which could be indicated
by a name, and the percipient’s result corresponded to the
extent covered by the name, it is easy to apply the theory of involuntary
whispering if the agent was near the percipient. Granting
that this was the case (which often, as will appear later, we cannot
grant, since the facts forbid it), it is easy theoretically to explain the
response “Sailboat” to the drawing of a sailboat. We have only to
suppose that the agent was so intently interested that, unknown to
himself, he faintly whispered the name, and that the percipient,
having <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex hypothesi</span></i>, abnormal alertness of hearing, caught the
word, or enough of it so that she successfully guessed the whole.
Still easier is it to imagine the transmission of Y in the series of
January 28–29. The agent, being absorbed and desirous, simply
whispered “Y, Y, Y,” until the percipient got it. The reader may
pick for himself other plausible instances in Mr. Sinclair’s book, or
even from the materials furnished in this Bulletin, such as the
helmet experiment (Figs. <a href='#fig_5'>5</a>, <a href='#fig_5a'>5a</a>). It is even conceivable that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>agent’s eye, flitting over the drawing of the peacock (Fig. <a href='#fig_75'>75</a>) caused
him to whisper “long neck” and “spots” or “eyes” (Fig. <a href='#fig_75a'>75a</a>), although
no spots appear in this drawing and “peacock” is the word
he would be expected to whisper, if any. But every increasing complexity
in the agent’s drawing, which finds duplication in that of
the percipient, every increasing difficulty of defining the drawing
by one or two words increases the difficulty of the explanation.
Take the remarkable correspondence between Figures 7, 7a. The
agent, it seems, would have to whisper the following, or its equivalent:
“Cross” (or “radiating figure”), “eight arms” (or “many
arms”), “arms not made of a single line but having breadth,”
“notches in the ends.” That is a lot for the agent to whisper, and
it appears improbable, but maybe it is “conceivable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A much-esteemed friend writes me: “Those willing to press
the unconscious whispering hypothesis to its extreme consequences
need not invariably postulate the <em>transmission direct</em> of a word.
They may go further. Let us suppose that in an experiment at close
quarters the name thought of by the agent is ‘Napoleon,’ and that
the percipient gets a small island and the name ‘Helen.’ It is theoretically
conceivable that, nevertheless, the explanation is to be
sought in involuntary whispering; the name ‘Napoleon’ was perceived
in a normal way (unconsciously) and then in the percipient’s
subconscious <em>transformed</em> into an idea associated with Napoleon’s
name. I do not say this is my opinion, but what I do say is that such
an hypothesis is no more absurd than other ‘explanations’ put forward
in the sphere of psychical research. Anyhow, experiments at
close quarters seem to be open to the grave objection that some
competent investigators reject them altogether—whatever we may
think of the grounds of such objection.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Conceivable, yes, though hardly likely. When a medium for
“automatic” writing or speaking is in undoubted trance, she habitually
makes direct response to any intimations from without, and
it is common to make it a reproach that she makes direct and unblushing
use of any information inadvertently dropped by a person
present. Why the subconscious should act in so devious a fashion
in another species of experimentation, why it should either from
device or some mechanism now set in motion withhold the word
“Napoleon” caught from the agent’s involuntary whispering and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>set down instead words significantly associated with Napoleon, is
something of a puzzle. The trance-medium’s subconscious, according
to the explanation theory, is always eager to shine, and takes
advantage of every source of information or inference to improve
its product. Yet the subconsciousness of the percipient in experiments
for telepathy, having heard the word “Napoleon” involuntarily
whispered, deliberately avoids achieving a full success! If
done at all, I should judge this was consciously done, that the percipient
consciously heard and consciously avoided the word. And
this is conceivable.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>But that there should be so many reproductions which strikingly
resemble the originals in shape, yet which do not represent
the objects which the agent drew, and have no more ideational
connection with them than can be traced between a cockroach and
an archangel, or between a violin and an eel, and yet that the
explanation for the correspondences should lurk in the involuntary
whispering of the agent, I maintain is practically inconceivable.</em>
Between Figures 25 and 25a there is an unmistakable close resemblance
of shape, in each two lines forming an inverted and sprawling
V, with a swirl of lines in each forming a similar shape of similar
dimensions proceeding in the same direction from the apex. But
the percipient wholly misinterpreted the meaning of what she was
impressed to draw. What affinity is there between an active volcano
and a “big black beetle with horns”? Run through all the
terms you can think of which the agent could have involuntarily
whispered descriptive of his drawing, if he whispered anything—“volcano,”
“mountain,” “smoke,” “angle,” etc., and what could
possibly have suggested the impression which the percipient received?
Look at Figures 118, 118a in the same series, and ask what
the agent could have whispered about his caterpillar which should
suggest a shape considerably resembling that of the caterpillar but
intended to represent a long narrow leaf with serrated edge. To be
sure, a caterpillar sometimes walks on a leaf, as a big black beetle
may perhaps light on the side of a volcano, but surely it will not be
concluded that the agent would have whispered so discursive a remark.
Whispering “caterpillar” would not result in “leaf,” and if
“legs” had been whispered, surely legs would have resulted and
“many” would at least have increased their number beyond the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>number of points in the reproduction. View again Figures 108
and 108a in the same series with the two foregoing. If the agent
whispered anything, would it not have been “hand,” solely first
and principally? Imagine, if you please, that he also whispered
“thumb sticking up.” But a negro’s head is not a hand, nor what
the word “hand” would suggest, nor does a thumb ever grow out
of a negro’s head, yet out of this negro’s head rises that projection
curiously like a thumb. Neither would “hand” suggest a “pig’s
head,” yet the pig’s ear resembles the thumb, and the rest of the
head carries a certain amount of analogy with the hand. Again,
“rabbit’s head” is written, but little more than the ears are drawn,
each a thumb-like projection, and as in the other attempts at reproduction
and in the original, straight upward. There is no association
of ideas between a hand and a pig’s or rabbit’s head. Look at
Figure 20, representing a coiled snake, and read again the description
of her impressions which the percipient wrote. Between the
snake and much of that description there <em>is</em> an association of ideas
which we can follow. The whispered word “snake” might naturally
rouse a picture of the fright which the apparition of a snake inflicts
upon birds and small animals. While it does not seem like either
the conscious or subconscious, having heard the word “snake,”
which surely would have been the first and foremost one to whisper,
to suppress it and make a clear success a debatable one, we
admit that this is “conceivable.” But what about the “saucer of
milk”? The agent may theoretically be supposed to whisper
“snake,” “coiled,” “tail,” “head,” but hardly “saucer.” I may here
be reminded that some snakes drink milk, whether from a saucer
or any other receptacle. But in Mrs. Sinclair’s imagery it is a kitten
that is associated with the milk—a much more common combination.
Leaving this case, which is conceivably conceivable as the
result of involuntary whispering plus a strange effort to spoil a
success in hand, let us turn to the series of February 15th. Most of
its members are to the point, but we will mention only a few. What
association of ideas is there between a spigot and a dog’s leg (Figs.
96, 96a)? The name “Napoleon” might indeed cause one to think
of an island named St. Helena, or another one named Elba, or a
woman named Josephine. But why on earth should the whispered
word “spigot” cause one to think of a dog’s leg and “front foot”?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>The association of ideas is not there, but the curiously resembling
particulars of shape are there. Whatever the agent may be supposed
to whisper in connection with the drawing shown in Figure
98, surely “box” would be a part of it. And as surely, if the three
marks of the box were mentioned in the whispering they would
have been called “crosses,” and not “stars” or “sparks” as in the
reproduction. And “crosses” do not naturally suggest either stars
or sparks. Figures 94 and 94a unquestionably have resemblances
in general shape, in the two pedals which are transformed into feet,
in vertical lines within the periphery. But why should the word
“harp” bring a woman’s skirt and feet peeping beneath it? Perhaps
we shall be told it is because a woman plays on a harp. A <em>woman</em>
does, yes, but not half a woman, and that half standing so that her
skirt takes the form of a harp. If conceivable that “Napoleon”
should rouse a vision of an island and induce the drawing of an
island, would the island take the shape of half of Napoleon’s body?
The mind, conscious or subconscious, does not act in that fashion.
Again, the percipient’s drawing which was the sequel to the agent’s
balloon (Figs. <a href='#fig_95'>95</a>, <a href='#fig_95a'>95a</a>) is not by itself recognizable as a balloon, and
was not recognized by the percipient as a balloon, for she wrote, as
we inadvertently neglected earlier to state, “Shines in sunlight,
must be metal, a scythe hanging among vines or strings.” The
involuntarily whispered word “balloon” would hardly, by any
association of ideas, have led to such a reaction; nor would the
agent have whispered “half a balloon” or “scythe.” But we <em>can</em>
understand how the agent’s eye may have dwelt upon one side or
half of the balloon and how his attention may have wandered to
the cords, with corresponding telepathic results. See Figures 92,
92a. Here the analogies of form, although imperfect, are nevertheless
unmistakable, but what association of ideas could have led from
the involuntarily whispered word “chain” or “links,” to “eggs” and
“smoke,” or to “curls of something coming out of the end of an
egg”? At a later date the agent drew a mule’s head and neck, with
breast-strap crossing the lower part of his neck, forming a strip
curving very slightly up from the horizontal. The percipient’s
drawing is of the head and part of the neck of a cow, turned in the
same direction. The long ears of the mule have become the horns
of the cow, and matching the breast-strap of the mule there appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>a narrow horizontally extended parallelogram in front of the cow’s
neck and extremity of its muzzle, which last the percipient seemingly
tries to explain by the script “Cow’s head in ‘stock.’” But if
the agent involuntarily whispered “mule,” it would hardly suggest
a cow, if he whispered “long ears,” it should not have resulted in
long horns, if “breast-strap” or “strap” or “harness,” this would
hardly bring as its reaction the narrow parallelogram, which, whatever
it is, is manifestly no part of a harness. The resemblances in
shape are distinct and unmistakable, but they are incomprehensible
as the result of overheard whispering. Or look again at Figures
78, 78a. The percipient, especially in the first of her two
drawings, very nearly reproduces the original, but the barb of the
fishhook has become a tiny flower with a curving stem. The resemblance
in shape is exceedingly impressive, but what words could
have been whispered about a fishhook which by association of ideas
led to the flower?</p>

<p class='c010'>So we might go on citing examples in the same category, which
the doctrine of transformation by association of ideas of words
whispered and heard utterly fails to explain. But the reader may
find them for himself, either in this Bulletin or from the wider
range of illustrations in <cite>Mental Radio</cite>.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c017'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c029'>Concluding Observations</h4>

<p class='c019'>We have remarked that if there was involuntary whispering, it
could easily explain the percipient response “Sailboat,” and that
by no circumambulatory process but by direct reaction, since the
original drawing was a sailboat and “sailboat” would be the most
natural if not inevitable word for an agent, intent on the experiment,
and anxious for its success, to whisper involuntarily. The
same may be said of the goat (Fig. <a href='#fig_138'>138</a>), the chair (Figs. <a href='#fig_16'>16</a>, <a href='#fig_16a'>16a</a>),
the fork (Figs. <a href='#fig_1'>1</a>, <a href='#fig_1a'>1a</a>), the star (Figs. <a href='#fig_2'>2</a>, <a href='#fig_2a'>2a</a>)—except the extraordinary
correspondence of odd shape, and the man’s face (Fig. <a href='#fig_20'>20</a>). But the
star and man’s face results were obtained when the agent was thirty
feet away in another room with closed door between, while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>agent looked at it but probably did not whisper so as not to attract
his own attention but to be audible through walls for thirty feet.
The chair and the fork were reproduced when the agent was some
thirty miles away. The sailboat and goat were made in the latter
period when the percipient was left alone with the drawings, and
involuntary whispering is not a possible explanation. Part of the
other examples given are from the period when Mr. Sinclair sat in
the same room and watched the percipient’s work, and partly from
the later unguarded period.</p>

<p class='c010'>So, in order to explain the results of the experiments as a whole
they have to be divided into three categories, and a different theory
applied to each.</p>

<p class='c010'>I. Experiments in which the agent was near the percipient.
Theory: <em>Involuntary Whispering</em>. Insuperable difficulty in applying
the theory: <em>Many of the percipient drawings are shaped significantly
like the originals in whole or in parts, yet do not represent
the same objects as do the originals, or objects which whispered
words relevant to the original objects would suggest, directly or
by association of ideas.</em></p>

<p class='c010'>II. Experiments of the later stage when the percipient was
left alone unwatched with the original drawings in her possession.
Theory: <em>Conscious or unconscious inspection of the original drawings</em>.
Difficulty which the theory faces: <em>The results did not improve
or undergo alterations due to a new cause during the unguarded
period</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>III. Experiments when agent and percipient were either
thirty feet apart in different rooms, with a closed door between,
under which circumstances it is incredible that involuntary whispering
could have been heard, or thirty miles apart, in which case
it is unquestionably impossible that involuntary whispering could
have carried. Theory: <em>Chance coincidence</em>. This is the only theory
left for such experiments, unless conspiracy is charged, and that at
different times would have to include not only Mr. and Mrs. Sinclair,
but Mr. Irwin, Mrs. Irwin, the Sinclairs’ secretary and Professor
McDougall. Refutation of the theory: <em>The experiments in
this class were of such number and had such success both in number
and quality as to challenge the production of any such success by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>guessing though hundreds of series each of an equal number of
experiments should be gone through with</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is credible that the large percentage of Successes and Partial
Successes in the first 14 experiments and 24 among the latest ones
should have been obtained by one method, that (aside from these)
during the earlier months another and quite different method
should have been employed, and that (still aside from these) later
a third and quite different method should have been resorted to,
and yet the whole mass of results be homogeneous? It would certainly
be expected that the inauguration of any new method would
in some way be reflected in the nature of the results. But the lot
produced with intervening distances too great to admit of the
involuntary whispering theory melts imperceptibly into the lot
produced with the agent and percipient together so that the involuntary
whispering process is conceivable, and this in turn melts
imperceptibly into the lot where all precautions are discarded, and
this again into long-distance experiments and out, without it being
possible to detect any changes in the character of the results at the
points of junction. Throughout there is homogeneity, some successes
being correct literally, some incompletely and partially, some
results only suggestive and some entire failures. Throughout we
find some corresponding in both shape and meaning, some in idea
but not shape, and some in shape only and misinterpreted by the
percipient; in fact, all the peculiarities of Mrs. Sinclair’s work are
to be found in about equal proportions in all stages. There is perceptible
a gradual though irregular tendency to decline in the ratio
of success achieved, but in such a manner that the decline cannot
be chronologically connected with any of the changes of method.</p>

<p class='c010'>The “peeking” theory cannot be applied to the experiments
of Class I. The “involuntary whispering” theory cannot be applied
to the experiments of Class II. Neither the “peeking” nor the
“involuntary whispering” theory can be applied to experiments of
Class III.</p>

<p class='c010'>Only the theory of chance coincidence can be applied as a
single explanation of the experiments of all three classes. Let this
be done and there is simply massed a greater amount of material
for the demolition of the chance coincidence theory by anyone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>who will undertake a large series of precisely parallel experiments
in Guessing.</p>

<p class='c010'>For myself, I am willing to say, perhaps for the fourth time,
that I am willing to rest the whole case on those experiments to
which no one, presumably, will have the hardihood to apply either
the theory of “involuntary whispering” or that of “peeking,” that
is to say, those experiments in which agent and percipient were
either in separate rooms or many miles apart.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>An Interpretation of Mrs. Sinclair’s Directions</h3>

<p class='c019'>Mrs. Sinclair, on pages <a href='#Page_116'>116</a>–128 of <cite>Mental Radio</cite>, outlines on
the basis of her own experience the method which she thinks best
calculated to develop an ability to attain at will a mental state which
will enable some of her readers to receive and record telepathic
impressions to an evidential degree. I propose, at the same time
recommending that prospective experimenters shall obtain the
book and read the full directions, to attempt a condensation of
them. To some extent I shall interpret them; that is, state them in
other terms, which it is hoped will not be the less lucid. As a matter
of psychological fact, you cannot “make your mind a blank,” though
you can more or less acquire the art of doing at will what you
sometimes involuntarily do—you can practice narrowing the field
of consciousness, so that instead of being aware of many things
external and of various bodily sensations, your attention is fixed
almost exclusively for a time on one mental object. Some persons
at times become so absorbed in a train of thought that with eyes
open and with conversation around them they are hardly conscious
of anything seen or heard. But it is best to assist the attainment of
such a state as Mrs. Sinclair does, by closing the eyes, and it is best
that silence should prevail. When one remembers how in revery
he has become oblivious to all around him, or how when witnessing
an entrancing passage in a play everything in the theatre except the
actors and their immediate environment has faded out of consciousness,
he will have no difficulty in understanding what Mrs. Sinclair
really means by saying that “it is possible to be unconscious and
conscious at the same time,” although taken literally that is not a
correct statement.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>But, according to her, in order to be in the state best fitted for
telepathic reception, it is not enough to narrow the field of consciousness
until, approximately, only one train of thought on a
mentally conceived subject occupies it. There must be cultivated
also, in as high a degree as possible, an ability to shut out memories
and imaginations, and to wait for and to receive impressions, particularly
those of mental imagery, which seem to come of themselves,
and to expend the mental energy upon watching, selecting
from and determining these.</p>

<p class='c010'>We are told that it is important to relax—“to ‘let go’ of every
tense muscle, every tense spot, in the body,” and that auto-suggestion,
mentally telling oneself to relax, will help. Along with this
there should be a letting-go, or progressive quietening, of consciousness.</p>

<hr class='c033' />

<p class='c010'>She wisely says that if in spite of you the selected mentally-visualized
rose or violet rouses memories by suggesting a lost sweetheart,
a vanished happy garden, or what not, you should substitute
thinking of another flower which has no personal connotations for
you. It must be some “peace-inspiring object,” even a spoon might
suggest medicine. The reader will understand that we are now
discussing the means for cultivating ability to fall at will into the
state for telepathic reception; we are not talking about experiments
with that end in view.</p>

<p class='c010'>After considerable practice of this kind one will tend to fall
asleep. It seems that it is right to nearly come to that point, but one
must stop a little this side of the sleeping stage.</p>

<p class='c010'>When one feels that some success has attended the practice
described above, he may proceed to actual experiments. The amateur
experimenter is advised at first to experiment in the dark, or
at least in a dimly-lit room, as light stimulates the eyes.</p>

<hr class='c033' />

<p class='c010'>She goes on to say what means that you should induce mental
relaxation and passivity, narrow the field of consciousness. But at
this point I must depart from Mrs. Sinclair’s precepts and recommend
her own best practice. Her very first seven formal experiments
were with her brother-in-law making his drawings some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>thirty miles away. The results were so remarkable that they deserve
to arrest the attention of every psychologist. The next seven experiments
were made with agent and percipient in different rooms,
shut off from each other by solid walls; and their results also were
very impressive. Therefore I see no reason why amateurs experimenting
according to the light that they get from Mrs. Sinclair
should not make their very first attempts in another room from the
agent. Let the latter do as we find in the book was done; make his
drawing, call out “All right” when he is done, and gaze steadfastly
at the drawing until the percipient has made hers and signalized
the fact by calling out “All right,” then proceed to make another
and repeat the process. At least part of the time, let there be another
person with the agent keeping watch upon his lips and throat
muscles, lest the desperate theory should be advanced that at the
distance of, say, thirty feet and through solid walls “involuntary
whispering” on the part of the agent reached the ears of the percipient.</p>

<p class='c010'>But how shall the percipient further conduct herself (we are
here supposing the percipient is a woman) as the means of getting
telepathic impressions? Adapting the directions given in the book,
we should say that, lying on the couch with eyes dosed, and having
sunk into that state of mental abstraction which she is supposed
now to be capable of attaining, she is to order her subconscious
mind, very calmly but positively, to bring the agent’s drawing to
her mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now we quote literally from the book, even to the expressions
about making the mind a blank. Although not technically
correct, it may be that to many not versed in psychology the expressions
will be actually the best to suggest to them what they are to do.</p>

<hr class='c033' />

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Sinclair warns that “the details of this technique are not
to be taken as trifles,” and that to develop and make it serviceable
“takes time, and patience, and training in the art of concentration.”
There are special difficulties, at least in her case. In undertaking
a new experiment what she last saw before closing her eyes again,
particularly the electric light bulb which she lighted in order to
make her drawing or drawings, appeared in her mind, and also the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>memory of the last picture. “It often takes quite a while to banish
these memory ghosts. And sometimes it is a mistake to banish
them,” a fact which we have noted several times in the account of
her work. Another difficulty is to restrain one’s tendency when a
part or what may be a part of the original appears, to guess what
the rest may be, and to keep the imagination bridled.</p>

<hr class='c033' />

<p class='c010'>It is quite probable—and this Mrs. Sinclair recognizes—that the
procedure, now fairly clearly outlined, may not in all its details be
suited to all minds capable of telepathic reception. Mr. Rawson,
as we shall see in Part II, when successful, was nearly always so
almost instantly. On the other hand, the percipients in the Schmoll
and Mabire series were often as long as fifteen minutes making
their choice. But it would be wise to begin along the lines of the
instructions, and make modifications of method, if any, in the light
of what personal experience suggests.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is hoped that there will be readers of this Bulletin disposed
to school themselves and to experiment in conformity with the
above instructions, patiently and persistently, and that, successful
or not, they will make careful records and report to the Research
Officer.</p>

<p class='c010'>There comes a time in the life of each of us when we begin to
wonder what it is all about—this life. I mean, to want, with all
one’s bewildered and troubled heart, to <em>know</em>. What is life, what
is the purpose of it, above all, what is the reason for the preponderance
of the pain of it? This brief earthly existence, with its series
of cares and sorrows and bafflements—what is the purpose of it?
It seemed so full of purpose in our youth—full, rather of purposes,
for youth has no one purpose. Youth’s purpose is to fulfill what
seems to be the little purposes of each day, such as evading unpleasant
things and pursuing the pleasant ones. But as we pass on
through the days of our youth, toward early middle-age, we realize
that these eagerly, zestfully pursued purposes of youth were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>thwarted, one by one. If achieved, they brought some penalty, or
disappointment.</p>

<p class='c010'>Three years ago, being ill and not happy,<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c017'><sup>[30]</sup></a> reached the crisis
of questioning. I wanted to know how to get well, and I wanted to
know why I wanted to get well. And so, I began to ask, where is the
path toward knowledge? In which little store-house will I find a
clue to the answer? I went to see the medical men who have access
to one little store-house. I went to the psychological healers who
have access to another little store-house. And I went to the only
religious group in the world today which seemed to have any real,
or living religion.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c017'><sup>[31]</sup></a> From all three of these sources, one clue, one
hint, stood out as a real clue. From the mass of purported knowledge
it appeared to me to be the most significant. It seemed to be
the thing which produced results in all these three domains, though
the priests and priestesses of but one of them seemed aware of the
great significance of this hint.</p>

<p class='c010'>It had to do with man’s mind, to begin with, but it seemed to
lead into the very heart of all the universe—into our “material
bodies,” as well as into our mental hopes and longings and joys and
despairs. So I set to work to experiment first with telepathy and
clairvoyance. If clairvoyance is real, I said, then we may have access
to all knowledge. We may really be fountains, or outlets of one
vast mind. To have access to <em>all knowledge</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>If telepathy is real, I said, then my mind is not my own. I’m
just a radio receiving set, which picks up the thoughts of all the
other creatures of this universe. I and the universe of men are <em>one</em>.
I had long known, of course, that my body was not my own—that it
picked up sun-rays, and cold-waves, and sound-vibrations, which
shook the atoms of my being into new forms; that I picked up iron
and sulphur, and phosphorus, and vitamines, and what not, when
I ate the plants and animals of my universe; in short, that I had to
pick up the constituents of a new body in the form of “fresh air”
and “water” and “food” every day of my life in order to maintain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>the hold I had on the thing I called <em>my</em> body. But somehow, in the
vague way in which we think of the mind, I had felt that mine was
entirely my own. Surely it was not dependent on, nor at the mercy
of, outside forces—except in the one horrible, inexorable way of its
dependence on my own body. It was free, of course, to accept ideas
from other minds, if it wished; but it did not have to, unless it
wanted to. So I had believed. Now, with my new clue, I began to
wonder if all my life I had not been in error in my thinking, if I
had not got the scheme of things turned upside down. Had I been
looking at an image in a mirror, a reversal of the truth? Was my
body dependent on my mind when I had thought my mind was
dependent on my body? Was it sick when my mind was, and did
it die when my mind died—of discouragement? And was my mind
my own, or did it receive and accept thoughts constantly from all
the other creatures of the universe without my being able to prevent
it, without my even knowing it?&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='c010'>What is myself, anyway—body or mind, or both, or one and the
same thing, or—what? I must find out! Is my mind a hodge-podge
of its own thoughts and the silent, ever-changing thoughts of all
other creatures, just as my body is a hodge-podge of the elements of
the plants and animals and light-rays it is fed on and made of?</p>

<p class='c010'>Here were a lot of questions which had become terribly important,
and I couldn’t answer them, I couldn’t really answer any of
them. But I had a clue—a new clue which might lead—anywhere—to
heaven or to hell.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='c010'>Some of the best scientific minds of the world have experimented
with telepathy and believe that it is a proven fact. I have
read much of this evidence, and I have watched a “medium” demonstrate
telepathy. But perhaps he was deceiving himself—perhaps
he used some trick without realizing it, such as listening to the
breathing of the sender of the thoughts he received. I do not see
how this could be, but it is possible, so I am told by experienced
investigators of psychic phenomena. However, there is this mass of
evidence, in books, written by men of the highest scientific training
who have made experiments in telepathy and who are convinced
that it is a fact.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='c010'>But despite all this evidence, I seem to be uncertain. And this
is too serious a matter to leave to uncertainty. So I set to work to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>make my own experiments. I have experimented already with a
“medium,” but I have been warned about the mediumistic temperament.
These psychically sensitive persons are, thanks to the
very quality of mind which causes them to be sensitive, overly prone
to unconscious thinking which is supposed to take a form of conscious
instability. So I must find a hard-boiled materialistic-thinking
person to experiment with—one who is prone to object thinking,
who can maintain a wide-awake consciousness with which to watch
his own thoughts to prevent any self-deception, while I, by a trustworthy
mechanical device, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, a writing pad and pencil, protect my
mind from deceiving itself. I find such a hard-boiled object mind
in the person of my brother-in-law, who is a most capable, practical
business man, and whose philosophy of life does not include any
“mysticism,” or unconscious knowledge. Being ill, however, and
with no better way to pass the time, he consents to act as sender of
telepathic messages to me. He is domiciled thirty miles away from
me, and so we cannot look over each other’s shoulders at drawings,
nor listen to each other’s breathing.</p>

<p class='c010'>We proceed as follows: Each day at one o’clock, an hour which
suits the convenience of both of us, he sits at a table in his home
and makes a drawing of some simple object, such as a table-fork, or
an ink-bottle, a duck, or a basket of fruit.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c017'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Then he gazes steadily
at his drawing while he concentrates his mind intently on “visualizing”
the object before him. In other words, he does not let his
mind wander one instant from the picture of the fork, or the ink-bottle,
or whatever he has drawn. He may gaze at the original
object instead of at his drawing, but he must not think of anything
else but how it looks. The purpose of the drawing is for proof to
me that this was actually what he thought of at the appointed hour.
If his mind wanders off to thoughts of something else, which he has
no drawing of, I may get these wandering thoughts. Then he will
forget these wandering, unrecorded thoughts, and I will have nothing
to prove that he ever thought them.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>When he has finished the fifteen minutes of steady concentration
on one object, he dates his drawing and puts it away, until the
time when we are to meet and compare our records. At my end of
the “wireless,” I have done a different mental stunt. I have reclined
on a couch, with body completely relaxed and my mind in a dreamy,
almost unconscious state, alternating with a state of gazing, with
closed eyes, into grey space, looking on this grey background for
whatever picture, or thought-form may appear there. When a form
appears, I record it at once. I reach for my pad and pencil and
write down what I have seen, and make a drawing of it, and
then I relax again and look dreamily into space again to see if
another vision will appear, or if this same one will return to assure
me that it is the right one. At the end of fifteen minutes, the period
of time we arbitrarily agreed upon for each day’s experiment, I date
my drawing and file it until the day comes to compare notes with
my brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c010'>Each day thereafter, for several days, my brother-in-law goes
through this same performance, varying it only by his choice of a
different object to draw and concentrate upon each time. Every
three or four days we meet and compare notes.</p>

<p class='c010'>One day, while I lay passively waiting for a “vision,” a chair
of a certain design floated before my mind. It was so vivid that I
felt absolutely certain that this was the object my brother-in-law,
thirty miles away, was visualizing for me. Other objects on other
occasions had been vivid, but this one was not merely vivid; in some
mysterious way, it carried absolute conviction with it. I knew positively
that my mind was not deceiving me. I was so sure that this
chair had come “on the air” from my brother-in-law’s mind to
mine, that I jumped up and went to the telephone and rang him
up. His wife was in the room with him and my husband was in
the room with me, and we called on them as witnesses—for we had
set out on the experiment determined that there was to be no deception,
of each other, nor of ourselves. I wanted the truth about
this matter—I was at life’s crisis, at the place where my whole soul
cried out, “What is the meaning of it all, anyway?” And my
brother-in-law knew my mood, and a painful, lingering illness was
rapidly bringing him to share it. My vision of the chair, and my
drawing of it, were entirely correct. This was our first thrilling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>success. Others followed it, and in the meantime, my husband and
I had made together some similar experiments, with success. Before
the summer was over, four persons—my husband, my brother-in-law,
his wife, and I—had become convinced of the reality of telepathy.
Then, having read a book by an English physicist (<cite>An Experiment
With Time</cite>, by J. W. Dunne), I began keeping records of my dreams
according to Mr. Dunne’s method, in order to see if, as he thought,
they would render evidence of foreknowledge of future events.
Clairvoyance is the usual term for this form of psychic phenomena,
but Mr. Dunne, being a physicist, is averse to mixing it with psychic
things to the extent of using the regular language, so he calls it “an
experiment with time” and writes a book about it in the language
of physics. Not being a physicist, I’m quite willing to stick to the
well-known word, clairvoyance, even at the risk of repelling those
ignorant persons who think that all psychic phenomena is trickery.
There are hordes of charlatans who call themselves mediums, just
as there are hordes of physicians who are charlatans, and of Christians
who are cheats, and of bankers who are dishonest. So, having
read Mr. Dunne’s useful book, I set out to record my dreams and
to watch for their “coming true.” Some of them did. Some which
could not be accounted for by coincidence. Some others came true
which were clearly due to telepathy between my husband’s mind
and my own. I dreamed that I was doing things which it turned
out he was actually doing, at a distance from me, and at the time
at which I was having the dream. Also, during these months, I made
some experiments on a young hypnotist I knew. I had no intention
of letting him hypnotize me, but I asked him to try to. I knew he
would never consent to the telepathy experiment if he suspected
it; he would not want me reading his secret thoughts. But he had
played some tricks on me, so I felt justified. And so, when he concentrated
on the task of putting me into a hypnotic sleep, I concentrated
on “seeing” his thoughts. Again and again I succeeded in
this experiment. I discovered his sorrows, his sins, his hopes, his
daily adventures. And I recorded them and faced him with them
and became his “Mother Confessor,”—and most generously rewarded
his unintentional confidence. I am sure he will agree that
I made a full return to him for the knowledge he inadvertently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>enabled me to obtain—the knowledge of the interaction of minds.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Such was the end of Dr. Prince’s study; as careful and precise
a piece of scientific investigation as I have ever come upon. She
did not fail to appreciate it, and to thank him. He died a couple
of years later.</p>

<p class='c010'>Craig survived him by a quarter of a century; but she did no
more experimenting. She had satisfied herself, her husband, and
such authorities as Dr. Prince, Prof. McDougall, and Albert Einstein,
and that was enough. Her mind went on to speculate as to
the meaning of such phenomena; to psychology, philosophy, and
religion. What was the source of the powers she possessed and had
demonstrated? What was the meaning of the mystery called life?
Where did it come from, and what became of it when it left us, or
appeared to? She filled a large bookcase with works on these subjects,
studied them far into the night, and discussed them with a
husband who would have preferred to wait and see.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the age of seventy she had her first heart attack, and from
that time on was never free of pain. For eight years I had her sole
care, because that was the way she wished it. Her death took many
weeks, and to go into details would serve no good purpose. I mention
only one very curious circumstance: During her last year she
had three dreadful falls on a hard plastone floor, and I had taken
these to be fainting spells. A few days after her death I received a
letter from a stranger in the Middle West, telling me that he had
just had a séance with Arthur Ford and had a communication from
Mary Craig Sinclair, asking him to inform me that her supposed
fainting spells had been light strokes. I called the doctor who with
two other doctors had performed an autopsy; I did not mention
the letter, but asked him the results, and he told me that the brain
lesions showed she had had three light strokes.</p>

<p class='c010'>I tell this incident for what it may be worth. I myself have no
convictions that would cause me to prejudge it, to say nothing of
inventing it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ford has promised me a visit.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Oliver Wendell Holmes was a poet and novelist, but as the <cite>Encyclopedia Britannica</cite>
says: “In 1843 he published his essay on the <cite>Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever</cite>,
which stirred up a fierce controversy and brought upon him bitter personal abuse, but
he maintained his position with dignity, temper and judgment, and in time was honored
as the discoverer of a beneficent truth.” It was about the same time that Semmelweiss
was making similar observations, but he did not take preventive measures until
1847, and Lister came still later.</p>

<p class='c010'>S. Weir Mitchell was one of the most prominent novelists of America at the close
of the 19th century, but he was also conspicuous as a neurologist and member of many
scientific societies.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mentality of a man cannot be determined by his profession or by his prevailing
occupation. Mendel, who influenced biology hardly less than did Darwin, was a
monk and an abbot. Copernicus, who revolutionized solar astronomy, was canon of a
cathedral, and astronomy was only his avocation.</p>

<p class='c010'>A thing <em>is</em> as it acts. An automobile is a good automobile if it behaves as an
automobile should. We shall see how Mr. Sinclair carried on his experiments and how
he reported them. At times he pursued a defective method, but he was aware of the
fact and reports it, while certain technically scientific investigators of telepathy and
other matters have not seemed even to be aware of their mistakes.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. From earlier correspondence and other sources, Mr. Sinclair was quite aware that
the man to whom he was sending the materials is hard-boiled enough to reject them
and drop the whole case or report on it adversely if the results of examination were
unsatisfactory.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. In some cases it might be necessary to increase rigidity of the conditions gradually,
as friendly confidence and ease of the percipient became better established. It is
futile to ignore the fact that nervous excitement and mental unrest are unfavorable
to success.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. For example, in 1906 Mr. Sinclair assisted the Government in the investigation
of the Chicago stockyards.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. If there are those who think there is no value in knowing something of the
make-up of the chief witnesses in this case, I emphatically do not agree with them.
That such knowledge is not absolutely determinative is, of course, true.</p>

<p class='c010'>We are investigating a field of phenomena by all the methods which are practicable.
The larger part of the phenomena are sporadic and spontaneous, and can
hardly be expected to occur in a laboratory. There are many cases where a man has
experienced but one apparition in his lifetime, and that at or close to the time when
the person imaged died. Will any director of a laboratory consent to keep people
under surveillance for a lifetime, to test if such an experience will take place in a
laboratory, and can any persons be found who will consent so to spend a lifetime?
And if under such conditions an apparition should be experienced and it should prove
beyond doubt that the person imaged died at that moment, even though the apparitional
experience occurred in a laboratory, in no sense would or could <em>laboratory</em> tests
be applied to it. The authentication of the incident would be the <em>testimonies</em> of the
scientific gentlemen present, to the effect that the story of the apparition was related
to them and written down before the death of the person was known, with, perhaps,
details of how the person who experienced the apparition looked and acted at the
time. But the testimonies of witnesses outside of the laboratory are evidence of precisely
as much weight, <em>provided that</em> their mentality and reputation for veracity are
equal.</p>

<p class='c010'>With favorable subjects experiments for telepathy can sometimes be and sometimes
have been carried on with all the rigidity of method and the scrupulosity of a
laboratory, or, if there remain doubts and objections on grounds seemingly almost of
as “occult” a nature as telepathy itself, doubtless in time to come methods will be
devised to meet these doubts and objections. But subjects of singularly calm and
poised nature will be required. It seems to be a fact with which we have to deal, however
regrettable, that with most persons who under friendly and unstrained conditions
at times strongly evidence telepathic powers, suddenly to place them in a room containing
strange apparatus, and before a committee of strangers, some perhaps cold
and stern in appearance, others whose amiable demeanor nevertheless betrays an
amused scepticism, is to make it improbable that they can exhibit telepathy at all. It
will have to be recognized as a scientific datum that a state of mental tranquillity and
passivity is generally requisite for such manifestations. Nor is this peculiar to psychical
manifestations; the principle applies more or less to a variety of psychological
manifestations and powers. Mark Twain could reel off witty utterances when he was
mentally at ease, but had he been surrounded by a solemn-visaged group of psychologists
with his wrists harnessed to a sphygmometer, and placed in face of an apparatus
for recording graphs and a stenographer with poised pencil, it is very certain that his
reactions would not have been those of brilliant and original humor. So I have seen
a prominent violinist, invited to play at a reception, try to keep on amidst the waxing
murmur of conversation, and finally falter and almost break down.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this laboratory-fixation age it is well to remember that certain even of the
physical sciences quite or mostly elude laboratory experimentation. Take astronomy,
a great and promising but difficult and problematical field of research. No sun of all
the millions, no planet, no planetary satellite, no comet, no tiniest of the asteroids can
be brought into a laboratory. Once in a while a meteoric stone reaches the earth, and
this can be analyzed, but no laboratory can control or predict time or place of its falling.
It is necessary to devise agencies, telescopes, spectroscopes and so on, which, in a
sense, go out and bring back data about the subjects of this science, and to develop
methods of mathematical deduction by which to reach conclusions which are accepted
by most people on authority only, since to most people the mathematics is quite
unintelligible.</p>

<p class='c010'>Astronomy, perhaps entitled to be called the most ancient of sciences, is one of the
most difficult. A multitude of theories to account for its multitudinous phenomena
have been supplanted by others; within the memory of persons now living many opinions
once firmly held have been discarded or at least called in question. This is not
in the least to the discredit of the science, but it is a fact. Today there are many contradictions
of opinion among astronomers. While an article by a scientific man was
printing in the <cite>Scientific American</cite> expressing the common view that in a little while,
about a million million years, the earth will become too cold for anybody to live on it,
another scientist was announcing to the world his reasons for questioning that conclusion.
Even facts of a declared visual character are called in question. Professor
Percival Lowell to his death in 1916 supported Schiaparelli’s announced discovery of
canals on Mars, described them as he saw them through the telescope, and declared
that they must be of artificial origin. It is said that there are astronomers who can
see the canals but who question that they are artificial. And it is certain that there
are astronomers who deny that there are any canals at all, and who claim that what
seem to be canals to some are optical illusions or sheer hallucinations. (Is not astronomy
getting to look like psychic research?)</p>

<p class='c010'>But in spite of all its shifting and reconstruction of theories, its assertions and
counter-assertions, the complexity and enormous difficulty of its numerous problems,
and the exceedingly subtle methods by which, in a great measure, these problems must
be studied, no one is so foolish as to think that astronomical investigation should not
be pursued, or that there does not lie before it a great field for the pursuit of truth.</p>

<p class='c010'>To a very large extent psychic research is analogous with astronomy. It, the
youngest of the sciences (by few as yet acknowledged to be a science), has a very difficult
field, lying as far apart from the ordinary life of most men as the multitudinous
realities of infinite space lie outside the range of thought of ordinary men; its problems
are many, theories are shifting and contradictory, certain facts are both affirmed
and denied, and, what is more to the point for our present purpose, only to a limited
extent can its problems be taken into the laboratory, but for the most part techniques
and logical methods have to be devised to fit the nature of the facts with which we
deal. In astronomy, most of the subjects of study can be found in place at any time;
the great drawback is that they are so fearfully distant as to be sensed very slightly.
On the other hand, with certain exceptions, either of kind or degree, the subjects of
psychical study cannot be found in place whenever wanted but appear occasionally,
yet when they do appear often do so with a nearness and clearness which spares the
witnesses the necessity of those cautious qualifying phrases so common in articles
dealing with astronomy.</p>

<p class='c010'>In order at length to turn the attention of scientific men to a quarter of reality to
which most of them are now voluntarily blind, we must continue to do what some
people contemn as “old stuff,” and that is to multiply the number of <em>intelligent</em> and
<em>reputable</em> witnesses by teaching people how to observe and how to record, and by ridding
them of the cowardice which now keeps at least five out of six potential witnesses
of such standing silent.</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. It is so judged from such expressions as “Or maybe she has been asleep and comes
out with the tail end of a dream, and has written down what appears to be a lot of
rubbish but turns out to be a reproduction of something her husband has been reading

<p class='c010'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. “I explain that in these particular drawings the lines have been traced over in
heavier pencil; the reason being that Craig wanted a carbon copy, and went over the
lines in order to make it. This had the effect of making them heavier than they originally
were, and it made the whirly lines in Craig’s first drawing more numerous than
they should be. She did this in the case of two or three of the early drawings, wishing
to send a report to a friend. I pointed out to her how this would weaken their value
as evidence, so she never did it again.”</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. Of course, there would be theoretical possibility that the four persons involved

<p class='c010'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. If it be objected that we are not told exactly what the conditions of the series of
February 15th were, though assured that all series were carried out with scrupulous
honesty, that is true. But it is also true that the results of this series were not better
than some where we do know that the conditions were excellent, and that this series
contains no successes of such astounding significance as three in the Sinclair-Irwin
Group, when many miles separated the experimenters. I would have been quite
willing to have employed for the guessing tests the originals in that group, plus those
of February 17th, done under excellently satisfactory conditions. (To be sure, the
parties were in the same room, but it will be shown later that, even granting all which
the egregious “unconscious whispering” theory claims, it could not account for the
results actually obtained.) In fact, the Sinclair-Irwin Group was avoided for the test
for the very reason that it is an exceptionally good one. That of February 15th was
selected because I wanted a series of a considerable number of experiments, an unbroken
one produced at one time, and one which exhibited results of a more nearly
average character.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. “<em>A</em> series” because there were other experiments at another hour of the same day.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. The general assumption is that Mrs. Sinclair got her successful results by telepathy.
But could Mr. Sinclair remember just in what order his drawings came, so to be
thinking of each just when his wife was holding that particular one? Unfortunately
he did not record whether he laid them down in the order of their production.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have judged Experiment 1 to be a failure. And yet it is not fanciful to say
that if the drawing of the globe is looked at from its left side there is considerable
resemblance between the very incorrectly drawn South America and Isthmus of Panama
on the one hand, and the “animal’s” head and neck on the other. If clairvoyance
were involved, there would be no necessary guarantee that the drawing would be
sensed—to a degree—right side up. Nor do we know how the envelope was held.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. Mr. Sinclair says, “Now why should an obelisk go on a jag, and have little circles
at its base? The answer appears to be: it inherited the curves from the previous fish-hook,
and the little circles from the next drawing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It is psychologically likely that a drawing just before made or even looked at
sometimes unfortunately influences a succeeding drawing. The most interesting apparent
example of this is Figure 8a made just after Mrs. Sinclair had been looking at
the several concentric circles of her last reproduction in the Sinclair-Irwin Group.
First she got a whirl of circles, then the whirl assumed the shape of a triangle, then
came two angles differently characterized, and finally the angles multiplied and constituted
a star duplicating the original. And a careful study makes it impossible to
doubt that there were anticipations. Some are too striking to be likely as accidents in
the same series, and in some cases Mrs. Sinclair announced ahead that such-and-such
an object would be found among the originals, and was right. Indeed, in cases where
a set of originals was not viewed by the agent one by one, as the tests were proceeding,
but were submitted in a heap together, it is a wonder that as a general rule the correspondences
were found in due order, and we are hardly able to explain it. I do not,
however, count any feature theoretically left over from the previous drawing as evidential,
but only as an interesting glimpse into the mental processes. Neither does
Mr. Sinclair, as I understand him. Nor do I reckon any “anticipation” as evidential,
unless it was announced in advance, and then only in a reduced degree. And Mr.
Sinclair’s principles of estimation were nearly the same. For he says (the italics mine):</p>

<p class='c010'>“Manifestly, if I grant the right to more than one guess, I am increasing the
chances of guesswork, and correspondingly reducing the significance of the totals.
What I have done is this: where such <em>cases have occurred, I have called them total
failures, except in a few cases, where the description was so detailed and exact as to be
overwhelming—as in the case of this ‘Happy Hooligan.’</em> Even so, I have not called it
a complete success, only a partial success. In order to be <em>classified as a complete success,
my wife’s drawing must have been made for the particular drawing of mine
which she had in her hand at that time</em>; and throughout this account, the reader is to
understand that every drawing presented <em>was made in connection with the particular
drawing printed alongside it—except in cases where I expressly state otherwise</em>.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. When she reached the snake original, the percipient made no drawing, but
wrote “Man running fast.” If the reader will turn back to Experiment 2 of February
8th, where the original was a snake, he will again find the cat’s tail and living things
fleeing. I more than ever suspect that buried in her subconsciousness is the memory
of some incident wherein a snake and a cat and something else in flight figure.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. O—original drawing. R—reproduction. Quoted matter was written by Mrs. S
as a part of her result.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. Statistically this must be rated a failure. But it is quite possible that in fact
there is an underlying real connection. Perhaps Mrs. S had read the life of Napoleon,
and had been aware that he was by education primarily an artillerist, and that the
increased and peculiar use of artillery was the chief distinctive feature of his campaigns.
If so, it is quite possible that the idea of cannon, struggling for emergence in
her mind, by association of ideas got sidetracked to Napoleon, and became expressed
in “Black Napoleon hat and red military coat.” I have not discovered what the uniform
of Napoleon’s artillerists was; his infantry, at any rate, wore coats brilliantly
faced with red.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f22'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. Let it be understood that there were reproductions rated as Suggestive, Partial
Successes or even Successes, where there was no such “correspondence.” That is to say,
the reproduction might not recognizably represent any living thing, might even be
indeterminable as to its nature, and yet so notably imitate the leading features of the
original (though omitting something necessary for identification) as to give it one
grade or another of ranking otherwise than Failure.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. Here the original was not a drawing but a “red flower” that Mr. Sinclair was
simultaneously reading about.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. Mathematically, that is, on the basis of a large number of counted experiments
in guessing.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f25'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. Unless by “involuntary whispering,” a theory to be attended to later.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. There was one experiment with drawings. One of the Danish experimenters
drew a candlestick, with a lighted candle in it. The other in response drew what in
the cut looks like a crooked milk-bottle with a short curved line proceeding from one
end and two short curved lines proceeding from one side. The latter says he meant it
for a cat, but does not know why he furnished it with only two “legs.” The only use
made of this drawing in the pamphlet is to compare it with a selected and very poor
example from the Richet series and to assert that it is as good a reproduction. The
utmost I should grant for the Richet drawing is that, regarded as one of a series containing
a number of far more impressive ones, it is Suggestive, and the most I could
grant for the “cat,” is that it may possibly be Slightly Suggestive. But did Hansen and
Lehmann think there was any resemblance between their reproduction and original?
If so, how did they know that there was no thought-transference and why did they not
continue to experiment with drawings? Were they afraid that if they did, they might
have an intractable problem on their hands? But if they thought there was no real
resemblance, what possible weight had their failure against a series of experiments
wherein a large percentage of the reproductions beyond question <em>did</em> notably resemble
the originals?</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. S.P.R. <em>Proceedings</em>, VI, 164–5.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. Professor Sidgwick declared that the whispering of himself and his colleagues
was certainly voluntary, and that there was no success otherwise.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. Neither M. C. S. or I ever made the faintest trace of a sound during an experiment.
That was the law. And I never knew which drawing she was holding. I had
just one order: to watch steadily, and be able to say that she never “peeked.” I did
this, and I say it, on my honor. This is an honest book.—Upton Sinclair.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. She was undergoing the menopause; hence the special depression. It is important
that every such fact should be stated. It might even be that the condition heightened
the telepathic faculty.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. Of course Mrs. Sinclair is solely responsible for this as every other of her expressed
opinions.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f32'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r32'>32</a>. This was written when it was expected that the experiments with the brother-in-law
would continue some time. The general character of the objects is stated. In
fact neither duck nor basket of fruit figured. The experiments with “Bob” soon
ceased, not only because they involved a strain upon him in his then condition of
health but because Mrs. Sinclair suspected that she was telepathically having her own
feelings of depression increased by his.</p>

  you are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
